<h2>INTRODUCTORY NOTE.</h2>

<p>The Editor would make his kind acknowledgments to the Church Missionary
and London Missionary Societies for the free use of the hitherto
unpublished correspondence of Mr. Samuel Marsden in their hands; and to
J. S. Nicholas, Esq., who accompanied Mr. Marsden on his first visit to
New Zealand, for the use of a valuable manuscript account of his
residence in New South Wales, containing much information respecting Mr.
Marsden. He has also had before him a manuscript life of Mr. Marsden by
Lieut. Sadleir of Paramatta, from which several extracts are made. And
lastly, he would acknowledge the courtesy of those surviving friends who
have placed in his hands Mr. Marsden&#8217;s autograph letters to themselves
or deceased members of their families. From these several sources the
work has been chiefly compiled.</p>

<p>The Editor may be permitted to add, that the similarity of his name
having led to the general conclusion (which however is incorrect) that
he was related to Mr. Samuel Marsden, he has been repeatedly urged to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg iv]</span>publish his life. At length this request being renewed by the Religious
Tract Society, into whose hands some valuable papers and documents had
fallen, he was induced to comply with their wishes, under the conviction
that the facts and incidents, as well as the moral grandeur, of Mr.
Marsden&#8217;s life, were too important to be suffered to lie any longer in
comparative obscurity. There are ample materials for a much larger
volume; but of course the Editor has been obliged to select what
<span class="pagenum">[Pg v]</span>appeared to be most suitable for general usefulness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<blockquote><p>Early Life of Mr. Samuel Marsden&mdash;His appointment to New South
Wales&mdash;Voyage, and arrival in the Colony.</p></blockquote>

<p>Samuel Marsden, whose life is sketched in the following pages, was not
ennobled by birth or rank, nor was he greatly distinguished by splendid
talents. Yet he was, in the true sense, a great man; and he was an
instance, one of the most striking of modern times, of the vast results
which may be accomplished when an honest heart, a clear head, and a
resolute mind and purpose, are directed, under the influence of the
grace of God, to the attainment of a noble object. While he lived he
shared the usual lot of those whose large philanthropy outruns the
narrow policy of those around them. His motives were seldom understood,
and in consequence he was thwarted and maligned. Nor was it till death
had removed him from the scene that either the grandeur of his projects
or the depth of his self-denying, unobtrusive piety was generally
appreciated. At length, however, his character has begun to be revered.
It is perceived that he was, at least, a far-sighted man;<span class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</span> and that in
his own labours he was laying the foundations for the successes of
thousands; while in the church of Christ he is had in reverence as the
Apostle of New Zealand&mdash;a title of high distinction, yet by no means
misapplied to one who, in the simplicity of his faith as well as in zeal
and self-denying labours, was truly an apostolic man.</p>

<p>Of his early life the memorials are but scanty. His father was a
tradesman at Horsforth, a village in the neighbourhood of Leeds; and
both his parents are known in the traditions of his family as having
been persons of integrity and piety, attached to the ministry of the
Wesleyan Methodists. He was born on the 28th of July, 1764, and after
receiving the elements of learning at a village school, was placed in
the free grammar-school of Hull, of which the celebrated Dr. Joseph
Milner, the ecclesiastical historian, and brother to the no less eminent
Dr. Isaac Milner, dean of Carlisle, was then head master. Here he was on
the same form with Dr. Dealtry, the late rector of Clapham and
chancellor of Winchester. Of his early youth little more is known; for
his modesty, rather than any sentiment of false shame, to which indeed
his whole nature was opposed, seldom permitted him to speak of himself,
or to dwell upon the adventures or incidents of his early life. He was
removed from school to take his share in his father&#8217;s business; but he
now had higher thoughts, and longed to be a minister of Christ. That he
was a young man of more than ordinary promise is at once evident from
the fact, that he was adopted by the Elland Society and placed at St.
John&#8217;s college, Cambridge, to study for the ministry of the church of
England.</p>

<p>The Elland Society, so called from the parish in<span class="pagenum">[Pg 3]</span> which its meetings are
held, is an institution to which the cause of evangelical truth in the
church of England has been much indebted for the last sixty or seventy
years. It is simply an association of pious members of the church of
England, who assist young men of enlightened zeal and suitable talents
with the means of obtaining an education with a view to the Christian
ministry. In its early days, the funds were supplied by Thornton,
Simeon, Wilberforce, and others like minded with themselves; and the
society was managed by a few devoted clergymen of Yorkshire and the
neighbouring counties; amongst whom were Venn of Huddersfield and Joseph
Milner. To this society Samuel Marsden was introduced by his friend the
Reverend Mr. Whittaker, a neighbouring clergyman; and not without some
apprehensions, it is said, on the part of the latter, lest his simple
and unassuming manner should create a prejudice against him. Such
anxieties were superfluous. The Milners themselves had fought their way
to eminence from the weaver&#8217;s loom, and well knew how to distinguish
real worth, however unpretending. The piety, the manly sense, and the
modest bearing of the candidate, at once won the confidence of the
examiners; and he was sent to college at their expense.</p>

<p>Of his college life we are not aware that any memorials have been
preserved. He was, no doubt, a diligent student; and from the warm
friendship which grew up between himself and Mr. Simeon in after life,
we may infer that he profited from his ministry. He had not yet
completed his studies or taken his degree, when, to his great surprise,
an offer was made to him by the government, of a chaplaincy in what was
then designated &#8220;His Majesty&#8217;s territory of New South<span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span> Wales.&#8221; That a
post of such importance should have been offered, unsolicited, to a
student hitherto quite unknown, is supposed to have been owing to the
influence of Mr. Wilberforce. He had already secured the appointment of
more than one pious chaplain to the colony, and from its commencement
had always been anxious to promote its moral and religious welfare. At
first, Mr. Marsden declined the tempting offer; for such it undoubtedly
was to a young man in his circumstances, although no human sagacity
could then foresee its vast importance. He was naturally anxious to
complete his studies, and he had a deep and unaffected sense of his own
incompetence, while yet so young and inexperienced. The offer, however,
was repeated and pressed upon him, when he modestly replied, that he was
&#8220;sensible of the importance of the post&mdash;so sensible, indeed, that he
hardly dared to accept it upon any terms, but if no more proper person
could be found, he would consent to undertake it.&#8221; The choice reflects,
no doubt, great credit upon the sagacity and spiritual discernment of
those who made it. &#8220;Young as he was,&#8221; says one who knew him well in
after life, Dr. Mason Good, &#8220;he was remarkable for a firmness of
principle, an intrepidity of spirit, a suavity of manner, a strong
judgment, and above all, a mind stored with knowledge and deeply
impressed with religious truth, which promised the happiest results.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was accordingly appointed as second chaplain to the settlement in New
South Wales, by a royal commission, bearing date 1st January, 1793. He
was ordained shortly afterwards, and proceeded at once to Hull, from
whence he was to take his passage in a convict transport, the only
conveyance, at that period,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span> for the far distant colony; a banishment of
half a world. On the 21st of April, he was married to Miss Elizabeth
Tristan, in whom, for upwards of thirty years, he found not only an
affectionate and faithful wife, but a companion singularly qualified to
share his labours and lighten his toils. Disinterested and generous as
he was, even to a fault, it was to her admirable management that not
only his domestic comfort, but even his means of assisting others so
profusely, was owing in no small degree. While at Hull, an incident
occurred which shows to what an extent, even thus early in life, he
possessed the art of gaining the respect and warm affection of those who
knew him however slightly. While waiting for the sailing of the ship, he
was frequently asked to officiate in various churches. One Sunday
morning, when he was just about to enter the pulpit, a signal-gun was
heard; his ship was about to sail, and it was of course impossible for
him to preach. Taking his bride under his arm, he immediately left the
church and walked down to the beach; but he was attended by the whole
congregation, who, as if by one movement, followed in a body. From the
boat into which he stepped he gave his parting benedictions, which they
returned with fervent prayers, and tender farewells. He now found
himself in a new world. What contrast could indeed be greater, or more
distressing? The calm, though vigorous pursuits of Cambridge, and the
pious circle of warm Christian friends, were at once exchanged for the
society of felons, and the doubly irksome confinement of a convict-ship.
From his journal, which has been fortunately preserved, we make the
following extracts, omitting much which our space does not permit us to
insert.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span>&#8220;<i>Sunday, 28th August, 1793.</i>&mdash;This morning we weighed anchor, with a
fair wind, and have sailed well all the day. How different this sabbath
to what I have been accustomed to! Once I could meet the people of God,
and assemble with them in the house of prayer; but now am deprived of
this valuable privilege; and instead of living among those who love and
serve the Lord Jesus, spending the sabbath in prayer and praise, I hear
nothing but oaths and blasphemies. Lord, keep me in the midst of them,
and grant that I may neither in word or deed countenance their wicked
practices.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>It was not till the 30th of September that the fleet in which his ship
sailed finally left Cork. The war with France was then raging, and her
fleets were still formidable; so that our merchantmen only ventured to
put to sea in considerable numbers, and under the convoy of a ship of
war.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;<i>Cork, 30th September.</i>&mdash;This morning the signal was given by the
commodore for all the ships under his convoy to weigh anchor and prepare
for sea. About nine o&#8217;clock the whole fleet was under sail, which
consisted of about forty ships. The wind was very fair, so that we were
quickly in the main ocean. I was soon affected by the motion of the
vessel; this rendered me quite unfit for any religious duties. Oh! how
miserable must their state be who have all their religion to seek when
sickness and death come upon them. Lord, grant that this may never be my
case.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Monday, 23rd October.</i>&mdash;I have this day been reading a portion of Dr.
Dodd&#8217;s &#8216;Prison Thoughts.&#8217; What an awful instance of human infirmity is
here! What need of humility in every situation, but more especially in
the ministerial office! How needful the apostle&#8217;s<span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span> caution, &#8216;Let him
that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The two following entries will be read with pain. The mercantile marine
of England is still capable of great improvement in matters of religion,
but we hope the instances are few in which the commander of a first rate
merchant vessel would follow the examples they record.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;<i>Sunday, 29th September.</i>&mdash;How different is this sabbath from those I
have formerly known, when I could meet with the great congregation! I
long for those means and privileges again. 'Oh, when shall I come and
appear before God?&#8217; Yet it is a great consolation to me to believe that
I am in the way of my duty. I requested the captain to-day to give me
permission to perform divine service to the ship&#8217;s company; he rather
hesitated, <i>said he had never seen a religious sailor</i>, but at length
promised to have service the following Sunday.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Sunday, 6th October.</i>&mdash;The last sabbath the captain promised me I
should have liberty to perform divine service to-day, but to my great
mortification, he now declines. How unwilling are the unconverted to
hear anything of divine truth!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>But Mr. Marsden was not one of those who are discouraged by a first
repulse. The next Sunday relates his triumph, and, from this time,
divine service, whenever the weather allowed, was statedly performed,
though the captain was a grossly immoral man, and Mr. M. was constantly
subject to annoyance.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;<i>Sunday, 13th.</i>&mdash;I arose this morning with a great desire to preach to
the ship&#8217;s company, yet did not know how I should be able to accomplish
my wish. We were now four ships in company. Our captain<span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span> had invited the
captains belonging to the other three to dine with us to-day. As soon as
they came on board I mentioned my design to one of them, who immediately
complied with my wish, and said he would mention it to our captain,
which he did, and preparations were made for me to preach. I read part
of the church prayers, and afterwards preached from the 3rd chapter of
St John, the 14th and 15th verses: &#8216;As Moses lifted up the serpent in
the wilderness,&#8217; etc. The sailors stood on the main deck, I and the four
captains upon the quarter-deck; they were attentive, and the good
effects were apparent during the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Thursday, 12th December.</i>&mdash;I have been reading of the success of Mr.
Brainerd among the Indians. How the Lord owned and blessed his labours
to the conversion of the heathen! Nothing is too hard for the Lord. This
gives me encouragement under my present difficult undertaking. The same
power can also effect a change upon those hardened ungodly sinners to
whom I am about to carry the words of eternal life.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>January 1st, 1794.</i>&mdash;A new year. I wish this day to renew my covenant
with God, and to give myself up to his service more than ever I have
done heretofore. May my little love be increased, my weak faith
strengthened, and hope confirmed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In this humble yet trustful spirit, Mr. Marsden entered his new field of
labour. On board the ship there were a number of convicts, whose daring
wickedness&mdash;in which, indeed, they were countenanced by the whole
conduct of the captain and his crew&mdash;grieved his righteous soul from day
to day; while at the same time it prepared him, in some measure, for
scenes<span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span> amidst which his life was to be spent. &#8220;I am surrounded,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;with evil-disposed persons, thieves, adulterers, and blasphemers.
May God keep me from evil, that I may not be tainted by the evil
practices of those amongst whom I live.&#8221; His last sermon was preached,
&#8220;notwithstanding the unwillingness there was in all on board to hear the
word of God,&#8221; from the vision of dry bones (Ezekiel xxvxii.) &#8220;I found
some liberty, and afterwards more comfort in my own soul. I wish to be
found faithful at last, and to give up my account with joy to God.&#8221; To
add to his anxieties, Mrs. Marsden was confined on shipboard, in stormy
weather, and under circumstances peculiarly distressing, &#8220;though both
the mother and daughter did well.&#8221; But the same day the scene
brightened; the perils and privations of the voyage were drawing to a
close, and they were in sight of their future home&mdash;that magnificent
Australia&mdash;destined hereafter to assume, perhaps, a foremost place among
the nations of the earth, though scarcely known to Europe when Mr.
Marsden first stepped upon its shores; and valued only by the British
government as a settlement for the refuse of our jails. He thus gives
utterance to the feelings of a grateful heart:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;<i>March 2nd.</i>&mdash;I shall ever retain a grateful sense of the mercies
received this day, and the deliverances wrought. The Lord is good, and a
stronghold in the day of trouble, and knows them that fear him.... As
soon as I had the opportunity to go upon deck, I had the happiness again
to behold the land: it was a very pleasing sight, as we had not seen it
since the 3rd of December. We came up with the Cape about noon.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In a few days, Mr. Marsden had taken up his abode<span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span> in the &#8220;barracks&#8221; of
Paramatta, a few miles from Port Jackson, and entered upon his arduous
and toilsome duties as chaplain to the colony. His first Sunday in
Australia is thus described:&mdash;&#8220;Saw several persons at work as I went
along, to whom I spoke, and warned them of the evil of sabbath-breaking.
My mind was deeply affected with the wickedness I beheld going on. I
spoke from the 6th chapter of Revelation.&mdash;&#8216;Behold the great day of his
wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?&#8217; As I was returning home,
a young man followed me into the wood, and told me how he was distressed
for the salvation of his soul. He seemed to manifest the strongest marks
of contrition, and to be truly awakened to a sense of his danger. I hope
the Lord will have many souls in this place.&#8221; He had, for a short time,
a single associate, in the Rev. Mr. Johnson, the senior chaplain, a good
and useful minister, but unequal to the difficulties peculiar to his
situation. This gentleman soon relinquished his appointment, and
returned to England. And thus Mr. Marsden was left alone with a charge
which might have appalled the stoutest heart, and under which even his
would have given way, had he not learned to cast himself for help on One
who comforted the apostle, under circumstances of the keenest suffering,
with the assurance, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for thee.&#8221; On that grace our
missionary chaplain trusted; and he found it all-sufficient.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<blockquote><p>Discovery and early History of New South Wales&mdash;Becomes a Penal
Settlement&mdash;Its state, moral and religious, on Mr. Marsden&#8217;s
arrival.</p></blockquote>

<p>The colony in which Mr. Marsden was now entering on his labours, and on
which he was to leave the impression both of his holy zeal, and his
far-sighted practical wisdom, is one of whose history our readers may
naturally wish to have some account. We shall therefore suspend our
narrative for a few pages, and lay before them a brief sketch of the
earlier days of the great Australian colony.</p>

<p>Europeans are indebted for their first knowledge of the existence of the
vast country which now bears the name of Australia, to the enterprise of
Spain and Holland, when these nations were at the head of the world&#8217;s
commerce, two centuries and a half ago. In 1607, Luis de Torres, who was
sent out by the Spanish government on a voyage of discovery, passed
through the straits which still bear his name, and which separate New
Guinea from the greater continent of Australia; but he was not aware of
its vast extent, and merely concluded that the coasts along which he
sailed were those of a group of islands. Just about the same time, the
Dutch explored the eastern shores of what has since been termed the Gulf
of Carpentaria; and their knowledge of Australia was extended by
subsequent voyagers, of whom the chief was Abel Tasman. In 1642, he
discovered Van Diemen&#8217;s Land, which was long supposed to be a part of
the great<span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span> continent named by the Dutch New Holland&mdash;the Australia of
modern times. Known as Tasmania, Van Diemen&#8217;s Land now immortalizes the
great sea-captain. But these discoveries led to no immediate results of
importance; and for upwards of a century New Holland was laid down, in
charts and maps, as a region whose coasts were not defined, and whose
interior was utterly unknown. Early in the reign of George the Third a
noble spirit of enterprise animated the British government. Voyages of
discovery were undertaken in the Southern Seas, under Captains Wallace,
Carteret, and others; and at length the celebrated Captain Cook may be
said to have retrieved a new world from romance and fable, and to have
made it over to England and to the best interests of mankind.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 19th of April, 1770, unknown land was descried
from the mast-head of the &#8220;Resolute,&#8221; of which Cook was the commander.
The rugged coast of a vast continent seemed to extend far beyond the
sweep of the telescope; and as the sun went down, the vessel, after
soundings, dropped her anchor within a spacious bay. The smoke of
distant fires told that the land was not without inhabitants; and it was
determined, if possible, to open a communication with them. In the
morning, a boat was rowed on shore, and the first Englishman set his
foot upon Australia. A forest extended to the beach, and dipped its
branches into the sea; while an abundant variety of beautiful flowering
shrubs delighted the eye; and from this circumstance &#8220;Botany Bay&#8221;
received its European name. A dismal solitude prevailed; for the
natives, one or two of whom had been observed crouching behind the
rocks, fled in terror to the woods as the boat<span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span> approached. After
spending a few hours on shore in search of water and fresh vegetables,
and in the vain attempt to communicate with the savages, the boat
returned at night. The bay was found to abound with fish; and the
sailors were glad to relieve the weary monotony of their many months at
sea, as well as to provide an agreeable change from their diet of salt
meat and mouldy biscuits, in fishing both with nets and lines. Fish too
was a wholesome diet for the sick; and at this period, even in the navy,
sickness, especially from the scurvy, almost invariably attended a long
voyage.</p>

<p>The natives, seeing the men thus employed, discovered in our sailors
some tastes common to themselves, and at length ventured towards the
fishermen in a couple of light canoes. After paddling about for some
time in evident suspense, they ventured to approach the boat, then came
still nearer and shouted, and having caught a few beads which were
thrown out to them, immediately retired. Gaining courage from the
peaceful conduct of our sailors, who were instructed to continue their
fishing without any attempt to follow them, the natives soon returned
with a canoe laden with fine fish, which they readily bartered for such
trifles as the boat was provided with. They were invited, by signs, to
come on board the ship lying in the offing, which they soon ventured to
do in considerable numbers. At first, they seemed harmless, scarcely
understanding the use of the various novelties on ship board, and not
much surprised by them; and honest, until the sight of ten or twelve
fine turtle crawling on the deck proved too great a temptation. First,
by signs they begged for some of these, and then, not succeeding, made a
childish attempt to carry<span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span> them off by force. They set little value on
the beads and baubles which generally have so great a charm for savages.
Nothing tempted them to barter but turtle or iron tools and nails,
neither of which could well be spared. On shore it was found almost
impossible to approach them; such was the distrust and dismay with which
they evidently regarded the intrusion of their strange visitors. On
further acquaintance the savages were discovered to be a singularly
helpless and timid race. Their country appeared to be very thinly
peopled, and that chiefly along the coast, for fish were plentiful and
wild animals were few. Of the latter, the largest was scarcely bigger
than a greyhound, and the first sight of it caused great amazement to
the sailors, one of whom rushed into the tent which had been pitched on
the shore for the use of the sick, declaring, with horror depicted on
his countenance, that he had seen an evil spirit. He described it as
having assumed the colour of a mouse with two fore-paws, but that it sat
upon its hind quarters &#8220;like a Christian.&#8221; An animal answering this
description was soon after shot, and the flesh, when roasted, proved
excellent food; it was called by the natives the kangaroo, and had
hitherto been quite unknown to Europeans. There were no beasts of prey;
unless wild dogs deserved that title, but the long grass concealed vast
numbers of snakes and scorpions. At night, the forests were disturbed by
the hideous flight of huge bats; by day, they echoed to the whooping of
cockatoos and the screaming of innumerable parrots. Crows and a few wild
pigeons were occasionally seen, and the rocks abounded with wild fowl,
while now and then an eagle might be seen soaring far above. Such were
the first impressions which Englishmen<span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span> received, from their great
voyager, of that vast continent.</p>

<p>On the return of Captain Cook, the accounts he brought home of New South
Wales suggested to the government the idea of making it a vast
prison-house for convicted felons, who had now become a sore burden, as
well as a cause of grave uneasiness, to this country. Its distance and
its solitude recommended it to their choice. It would effectually rid
the mother country of a dangerous class&mdash;this was the argument of the
selfish; and it would afford the lost the opportunity of starting afresh
in life&mdash;this was the hope of the few benevolent and humane who cared
for the welfare of convicted felons. No one thought of the future
grandeur of Australia. None wrote or spoke at present of our duties to
the aboriginal savages, or probably wasted a thought on the subject of
their conversion.</p>

<p>In 1778, Botany Bay was selected by Sir Joseph Banks, who had sailed
with Captain Cook as a naturalist and scientific observer, as a most
eligible site for a penal settlement. But the project was no sooner
broached than it had to encounter the most determined opposition from
the public, to most of whom it seemed no doubt utterly chimerical and
absurd. The &#8220;Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine,&#8221; the great organ of literature and
science at that time, led the van. At first the editors affected to
treat the scheme as an extravagant hoax; afterwards they tell their
readers &#8220;with what alarm they read in the public prints that so wild a
project was actually to be carried into execution.&#8221; However, &#8220;it could
never be countenanced by any professional man after a moment&#8217;s
reflection. Not only the distance, but the utter impossibility of
carry<span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>ing a number of male and female felons across the line, without
the ravages of putrid disorders sweeping them off by the score, must for
ever render such a plan abortive. The rains, the heats, tempests,
tornados, and mountainous seas to be encountered, were enough to deter
the most reckless of human life from such a hazardous enterprise. If any
such desperadoes could be found, they ventured to foretell that their
fate would for ever be a warning to others not to repeat the attempt.&#8221;
The subject was not suffered to rest; a few months afterwards <span class="smcap">Sylvanus
Urban</span>&mdash;for under this name the editors of that able journal have for
upwards of a century disguised themselves&mdash;returned to the charge. &#8220;The
ostensible design of the projector,&#8221; they say, &#8220;to prepare a settlement
for the reception of felons on the most barren, least inhabited, and
worst cultivated country in the southern hemisphere, was beyond belief.&#8221;
Moreover, &#8220;Botany Bay was beyond the reach of succour or assistance from
any European settlement.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then again the lavish expense of such an establishment was another
serious objection. &#8220;It was said that it was to consist of a
post-captain, a governor, with a salary of 500<i>l.</i> a-year, a master, and
commander. A lieutenant-governor, with 300<i>l.</i> a-year, four captains,
twelve subalterns, twelve sergeants, and one hundred and sixty rank and
file from the marines; a surgeon, chaplain, and quartermaster. The whole
equipment, army, navy, and felons, were to be supplied with two years&#8217;
provisions, and all sorts of implements for the culture of the earth,
and hunting and fishing. Some slight buildings were to be run up until a
proper fort and a town could be erected. If such a report could be true,
the expense would equal that of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span> an expedition to the South Seas against
an enemy.&#8221; If such extravagance were repeated with every freight of
felons, &#8220;it would furthermore extinguish all hope of paying off the
national debt.&#8221;</p>

<p>We leave the reader to smile while he muses on the short-sightedness
even of wise men, and the strange fluctuations of human opinion. The
government persevered in spite of these prophetic warnings; which
probably represented the general state of feeling on the subject among
educated men in England, with whom, in those days, <i>Sylvanus</i> was no
mean authority. Accordingly, in March 1787, eleven sail, consisting of
the frigate Sirius, an armed tender, three store-ships, and six
transports, assembled at Portsmouth, having on board five hundred and
sixty-five male, and one hundred and ninety-two female convicts, under
Captain Arthur Phillip, an experienced officer, who was appointed
governor of the new colony. The fleet set sail from the Mother Bank, on
the 13th of May, 1787, and after a tedious voyage of eight months, the
whole convoy arrived safely in Botany Bay in the middle of January,
1788. But Captain Cook&#8217;s description of the country surrounding the Bay
was found far too flattering&mdash;the harbour being exposed to tempestuous
gales, which often rolled a heavy sea upon the beach, while the land was
deformed with swamps and barren sand banks. On pressing forward to a
neighbouring creek, marked by Captain Cook as a mere boat harbour,
Governor Phillip had the satisfaction to find one of the finest havens
in the world, in which a thousand sail of the line might ride in safety.
It was then called Port Jackson. The different coves of this harbour
were examined with all possible expedition, and the preference was given
to one which<span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span> had the finest spring of water, and in which ships might
anchor so close to the shore that, at a very small expense, quays could
be constructed where the largest vessels might unload. This cove is
about half a mile in length, and about a quarter of a mile across at the
entrance. In honour of Lord Sydney, the governor distinguished it by the
name of Sydney Cove. On the twenty-sixth of February, 1788, the British
colours were displayed on these shores; the plan of an encampment, the
first rude outline of the metropolitan city of <span class="smcap">Sydney</span>, was formed. The
spot chosen was at the head of the cove, near a stream of fresh water,
which stole silently along by a thick wood now the site of crowded
streets, the stillness of which for the first time since the creation
was then broken by the rude sound of the labourer&#8217;s axe, and the hum of
busy men. The anniversary of this great event has for some years been a
festival in New South Wales. Governor Phillip landed with a thousand and
thirty souls; his live stock consisted of six head of horned cattle and
seven horses. The town and district of Sydney has now a population of
three hundred thousand souls; every year the increase is enormous; and
the ratio of each year&#8217;s increase exceeds the last.</p>

<p>These figures, however, make but a feeble impression upon us at a
distance. The colonists feel a warmth of enthusiasm such as only the
sight of the marvellous contrast can create. We copy the following
extract from the Sydney Herald on one of these anniversaries&mdash;&#8220;the
nativity of the city of Sydney and of the colony of New South Wales.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When we compare the town and the country as they are now with what they
were then, we may well be proud of British enterprise, and of the local
re<span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>sources which it has so rapidly and triumphantly developed. How
forcibly are we reminded of the miraculous transformation foretold by
the inspired son of Amoz&mdash;&#8216;The wilderness and the solitary place shall
be glad for them, and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.&#8217;
Let the imagination attempt this day to realize the enchanting contrast.
As we look upon the noble ships riding in our harbour, and the steamers,
yachts, wherries, and boats innumerable, gliding to and fro amid the
joyous excitements of the regatta, let us picture the three humble boats
which, this day fifty-seven years,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> were slowly creeping up the
unknown waters of Port Jackson, in quest of a sure resting-place for our
first predecessors. As we cast our eye over the elegant buildings which
now skirt our shores on either side, and over the crowds of well-dressed
men, women and children, who are keeping holiday on this our national
festival, let us think of the dense woods which then frowned on Governor
Phillip, of the profound silence that reigned around him, of the awful
sense of solitude with which he and his little band must have been
impressed, and of the exultation they would have felt could they have
foreseen that, within so brief a term, the wilderness they were
approaching would have become &#8216;replenished&#8217; with a teeming population,
and have been &#8216;subdued&#8217; to the beauty and affluence of civilized life.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the dark side of this romantic picture must not be withheld. The
infant colony was chiefly composed of the worst class of felons; they
were the days of barbarous justice even in England, and it would often
be difficult to say why some convicts were sentenced to transportation,
while others for lighter causes were <span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span>punished with death. There was, at
that time, a fearful indifference to human life in our penal code.
Punishment was its sole object; amendment was seldom if ever
contemplated. Amongst the convicts there was every shade of crime, but
scarcely any corresponding gradation of punishment. The truth is, true
religion was at its lowest ebb, and pure philanthropy, in consequence,
all but unknown; a formal, heartless religion prevailed; and, as one of
its fruits, a stern and iron code of law. The convict-ship, which has
now become a reformatory school, was rivalled in its horrors only by the
slave-ship; indeed if the physical suffering was greater in the latter,
in moral torture and mental defilement the hold of the convict-ship had,
beyond all doubt, the bad pre-eminence.</p>

<p>The prisoners consisted of the most abandoned persons of all nations;
British, Dutch, and Portuguese sailors, the polite swindler, and the
audacious highwayman, with their female accomplices. They were shipped
off in chains; during the passage outward a detachment of soldiers was
constantly on guard; and the voyage was seldom accomplished without
bloodshed. The secret plots, in which the prisoners were continually
engaged, broke out into open mutiny whenever circumstances offered a
chance of success; for this purpose a storm, a leak, or a feigned
sickness, was readily taken advantage of. When signs of such
disturbances showed themselves, the ringleaders were seized and tried in
a summary way by court martial; but the sailors often refused to enforce
the sentence, so that it became necessary to compel obedience with
loaded muskets.</p>

<p>The hold of a convict-ship presented a melancholy picture of human
depravity. In the course of the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span> voyage most of the felons survived the
sense of shame: the sounds of ribaldry and boisterous mirth, mingled
with catches from the popular songs of the day, issued unceasingly from
the prisoners&#8217; deck; this uproar was ever and anon increased by more
riotous disturbances, blows and bloodshed followed; and occasionally the
monotony of the voyage was broken by mock trials among the prisoners, to
show that even in the most profligate and abandoned the principle of
justice was not altogether destroyed. When a prisoner committed an
offence against his fellows, a judge was appointed, advocates were
assigned to the prosecutor and the accused, a jury was sworn to try
according to the evidence, witnesses were examined, and the prisoner,
being found guilty, was sentenced to an immediate and brutal punishment.</p>

<p>From such elements the society of New South Wales was formed. Most of
the convicts, after a short servitude, obtained tickets-of-leave, and
settled upon the parcels of land allotted to them by government; and by
the improvement of such opportunities they easily drew a subsistence
from the soil; others devoted themselves to the care of cattle; while
many more, as the colony increased, betook themselves to trade, by which
means large fortunes were frequently acquired. Many of the convicts in
the course of a few years contrived to amass great wealth, which was
expended in the extension, or improvement of their property. The results
of such industry were to be seen in the cleared inclosures, the neat
orchard, and the trim garden that here and there surrounded a well-built
brick-house. Even here honest labour seems to have been crowned with
success.</p>

<p>Free settlers were at present few in number, and the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span> convict on his
plot of land had many advantages over them. From acquaintance with the
climate and the modes of cultivation best suited to the soil, as well as
the easiest method of carrying on agricultural operations, he had
learned to avoid many fruitless experiments. He understood the habits
and character of the servants who assisted him, for the labourers were
all of them felons; and he himself had probably shared the same cell,
and worked in the same gang. He understood their principles of action;
and they were infected with his prejudices. They lived together, ate at
the same board and slept under the same roof. Thus a good understanding
was maintained between them by his connivance with their follies or
their vices. The men themselves always preferred a master who had been a
prisoner to a free settler of stricter virtue, and a disposition less
akin to their own; and for such an one they would make extraordinary
exertions, of great importance at seed time and harvest, which a better
master could not obtain at any cost.</p>

<p>A brotherhood and close fellowship, the fruit of old associations,
sprang up among the convict population. Many considered themselves as
martyrs to the vengeance rather than the justice of the law; others,
transported for political offences, regarded themselves in the light of
patriots. In short a unity of interest cemented them; and each newly
arrived convict ship was heartily welcomed. When it anchored in the
harbour boats swarmed around it, the decks were crowded, the new comers
were loaded with presents of fresh bread and other luxuries. They were
pressed with eager inquiries after absent friends, the comrades they had
left in English jails. They were greeted with the heartiness of old
companions, and without<span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span> reluctance exchanged the close confinement of
the convict ship for the fellowship of their old acquaintance on shore.
The colony at this time abounded with Irish who had shared in the
rebellion of 1798, and who generally brought with them a fair knowledge
of agriculture without very industrious habits. They attached little
turpitude to their offences, considering themselves rather as sacrificed
to the cause of freedom. Indeed it is well ascertained that some of them
had been banished without even the formality of a trial, some without
any specific sentence as to the term of their transportation, victims to
the angry spirit of the times. They are described as, for the most part,
conducting themselves with great propriety in the hope of one day
regaining their freedom, and being restored to their long absent
friends. Such men as these proved excellent colonists, and successful
settlers.</p>

<p>The criminal history of the colony in its first years discloses a
dreadful list of both crimes and punishments. Small bodies of the
convicts occasionally broke loose, fled to the woods, and there, setting
all restraints at defiance, became reckless and ferocious. The dread of
punishment did not restrain them from robbery, murder, and the most
appalling crimes. The risks were well calculated, for the chances of
conviction were few, and punishment was uncertain. If they were
detected, a convict, being dead in law, could not be summoned as a
witness. The jury would probably be composed of men who had been sharers
in crimes of equal magnitude, perhaps old associates. The prisoners
would be defended by convict attorneys, a nefarious class with which the
colonial courts were filled. Ineffectual attempts were made to exclude
these men, but the influence they had been suffered<span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span> already to attain,
made this impracticable. Amongst the most notorious of them was one who
obtained a large practice by dint of his ingenuity, and managed the most
important business in the colony. He had been some years previously
sentenced to transportation for life, for forging a will. He had
resorted to the ingenious device of putting a <i>fly</i> into the mouth of a
dead man, and then guiding his hand to trace his signature to the
writing; and, upon the trial, he swore, with audacious assurance, that
he saw the testator sign the will while <i>life</i> was in him. In passing
sentence, the late Lord Ellenborough took the opportunity of
congratulating the profession on getting rid of such a pest.</p>

<p>The records of the court are scarcely less painful than the history of
the criminals themselves. The punishments adjudged were frightfully
severe. If they did not reclaim the prisoner, they must have hardened
him beyond recovery, if indeed they did not in many instances torture
him to death. The men thus punished were already convicts it is true,
and more than usual severity may have been justified. But no penal code
emanating from a people professing the name of Christ may inflict savage
and barbarous penalties. They recoil with disgrace upon the legislation
which exacts them, and a whole nation is degraded in the person of its
own malefactors; while God&#8217;s displeasure is evident both in the increase
and audacity of criminals on the one hand, and in the loss of humane and
virtuous sentiments throughout the community on the other. We have taken
three cases as a specimen of the method in which justice was dealt out
to criminals in the early days of the colony in New South Wales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>&#8220;John Allen, stealing in dwelling-house to the value of forty shillings.

<p>Such was the sphere of Mr. Marsden&#8217;s labours, such the difficulties with
which he had to contend, and the system, too, which, as a magistrate, he
was even called upon to administer. A more hopeless task could scarcely
have been undertaken; but he set himself vigorously to work, looking to
the Strong One for strength, and the fruit was &#8220;seen after many days.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Marsden appointed to the Magistracy&mdash;Objections to this
considered&mdash;Cultivates Land&mdash;Charge of Secularity considered&mdash;His
connexion with the London Missionary Society, and care of its
Polynesian Mission&mdash;Revisits England in 1807.</p></blockquote>

<p>The retirement of the senior chaplain left Mr. Marsden in sole charge of
the spiritual concerns of the infant colony. He had now to officiate at
the three settlements of Sydney, Paramatta, and Hawkesbury without
assistance. The nature of the population, consisting as it did of a mass
of criminals, rendered his ministerial labours peculiarly distressing.
The state of morals was utterly depraved; oaths and ribaldry, and
audacious lying were universal; marriage, and the sacred ties of
domestic life, were almost unknown, and those who, from their station,
should have set an example to the convicts and settlers, encouraged sin
in others by the effrontery of their own transgressions. Under
discouragement such as would have subdued the spirit of most men, did
he, for the long period of fourteen years, continue at his post; cheered
it is true with occasional gleams of success, but upon the whole rather
a witness against abounding vice, than, at present, a successful
evangelist. Nor were domestic trials wanting to complete that process of
salutary discipline by which &#8220;the great Shepherd of the sheep&#8221; was
preparing his servant for other and wider scenes of labour, and for
triumphs greater than the church in these later days had known. His
firstborn son, a lovely and promising child scarcely two<span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span> years old,
was thrown from its mother&#8217;s arms by a sudden jerk of the gig in which
they were seated, and killed upon the spot. It would be impossible to
describe the agonized feelings of the mother under such a bereavement,
nor were the sorrows of the father less profound. He received the
tidings, together with the body of his lifeless boy, we are told, with
&#8220;calm, and even dignified submission,&#8221; for &#8220;he was a man who said little
though he felt much.&#8221; A second stroke, still more painful, was to
follow. Mrs. Marsden, determined not to hazard the safety of another
child, left her babe at home in charge of a domestic while she drove
out. But her very precaution was the occasion of his death: the little
creature strayed into the kitchen unobserved, fell backwards into a pan
of boiling water, and its death followed soon after. Thus early in his
ministerial career the iron entered his own soul, and taught him that
sympathy for the wounded spirit which marked his character through life.</p>

<span class="caption">DISTANT VIEW OF SYDNEY</span>
</div>

<p>But from these scenes of private suffering we must turn aside. The
public life and ministerial labours of Mr. Marsden require our
attention; and as we enter upon the review of them we must notice two
circumstances which from the very outset of his career exposed him to
frequent suspicion and obloquy, both in the colony and at home, and
formed in fact the chief materials, so to speak, out of which his
opponents wove the calumnies with which they harassed the greater
portion of his life.</p>

<p>He had scarcely arrived at his post when he was appointed a colonial
magistrate. Under ordinary circumstances, we should condemn in the
strongest manner the union of functions so obviously incom<span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>patible as
those of the Christian minister and the civil judge. To use the words of
a great living authority on judicial questions, a late lord
chancellor,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> &#8220;it is the union of two noble offices to the detriment of
both.&#8221; Yet it seems in the case before us, that the office was forced
upon Mr. Marsden, not as a complimentary distinction, but as one of the
stern duties of his position as a colonial chaplain, who was bound to
maintain the authority of the law amidst a population of lawless and
dangerous men. Port Jackson, or Botany Bay as it was generally called,
was then and long afterwards merely a penal settlement. The governor was
absolute, and the discipline he enforced was, perhaps of necessity,
harsh and rigid. Resistance to the law and its administrators was of
daily occurrence; life and property were always insecure, and even armed
rebellion sometimes broke out. If the government thought it necessary,
for the safety of this extraordinary community, to select a minister of
the gospel to fill the office of a magistrate, he had no alternative but
to submit, or else to resign his chaplaincy and return home. Mr. Marsden
chose to remain; moved by the hope of being able to infuse something of
the spirit of the gospel into the administration of justice, and to
introduce far higher principles than those which he saw prevailing
amongst the magistrates themselves. In both of these objects he
succeeded to an eminent extent, though not till after the lapse of
years, and a remonstrance carried by himself in person to the government
at home. Justice was dealt even to the greatest criminals more fairly,
and the bench of magistrates grew at length ashamed, in the presence of
the chaplain of Paramatta, of its own <span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>hitherto unabashed
licentiousness. But the cost was great. He was involved in secular
business from day to day, and that often of the most painful kind. His
equal-handed justice made him a host of personal enemies in those whose
vices he punished; and, still more, in those whose corrupt and partial
administration of the law was rebuked by the example of his integrity.
In the share he was obliged to take in the civil affairs of the colony
differences of opinion would naturally arise, and angry feelings would,
as usual follow. Of course he was not free from human infirmity, his own
temper was sometimes disturbed. Thus for years, especially during his
early residence in New South Wales, he was in frequent collision with
the magistrates, and occasionally even with the governor. Again and
again he would have resigned his commission, but was not allowed to do
so; meanwhile his mind was often distracted and his character maligned.
To these trials we shall be obliged to refer as we trace his steps
through life; but we mean to do so as seldom as we can, for the subject
is painful, and, since few men can ever be placed in his circumstances,
to most of us unprofitable.</p>

<p>Another point on which Mr. Marsden&#8217;s conduct has been severely, and yet
most unjustly blamed, is that he was engaged in the cultivation of a
considerable tract of land. Avarice and secularity were roundly charged
upon him in consequence; for it was his painful lot through life to be
incessantly accused not only of failings of which he was quite
guiltless, but of those which were the most opposite to his real
character. A more purely disinterested and unselfish man perhaps never
lived. One who under the constant disturbance of every kind of business
and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span> employment, still &#8220;walked&#8221; more &#8220;humbly with his God,&#8221; is not often
to be found. Yet the cry once raised against him was never hushed; until
at length, having rung in his ears through life, as a warning to him, no
doubt, even in his brightest moments of success, that he should &#8220;cease
from man,&#8221; it was suddenly put to shame at last and buried with him in
his grave.</p>

<p>The circumstances were these: When he arrived in the colony, in the
beginning of 1794, it was yet but six years old. The cultivation of land
had scarcely begun; it was therefore dependent on supplies of food from
home, and was often reduced to the brink of famine. One cask of meat was
all that the king&#8217;s stores contained when Mr. Marsden first landed on
those shores from which the produce of the most magnificent flocks and
herds the world has ever pastured was afterwards to be shipped. Governor
Phillip, as we have seen, had laid the foundation of the colony amid
scenes of difficulty and trial which it is fearful to contemplate. In
September, 1795, Captain Hunter arrived, and following in the steps of
his predecessor, exerted himself in clearing land and bringing it under
cultivation. To effect this he made a grant to every officer, civil and
military, of one hundred acres, and allowed each thirteen convicts as
servants to assist in bringing it into order. Mr. Marsden availed
himself of the grant, and his farm soon exhibited those marks of
superior management which might have been looked for by all who were
acquainted with the energy of his character and his love of rural
pursuits. Where land was to be had on such easy terms, it was not to be
desired or expected that he should be limited to the original grant. He
soon possessed an estate of several hun<span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span>dred acres&mdash;the model farm of
New South Wales;&mdash;and, let it not be forgotten, the source from whence
those supplies were drawn which fed the infant missions of the Southern
Seas, while at the same time they helped their generous owner to support
many a benevolent institution in his own parish and neighbourhood. Years
afterwards he was induced to print a pamphlet in justification of his
conduct in this as well as other particulars on which it was assailed;
and as we copy an extract from it, our feeling is one of shame and
sorrow that it should ever have been required. He says, &#8220;I did not
consider myself in the same situation, in a temporal point of view, in
this colony as a clergyman in England. My situation at that period would
bear no such comparison. A clergyman in England lives in the very bosom
of his friends; his comforts and conveniences are all within his reach,
and he has nothing to do but to feed his flock. On the contrary, I
entered a country which was in a state of nature, and was obliged to
plant and sow or starve. It was not from inclination that my colleague
and I took the axe, the spade, and the hoe: we could not, from our
situation, help ourselves by any other means, and we thought it no
disgrace to labour. St. Paul&#8217;s own hands ministered to his necessities
in a cultivated nation, and our hands ministered to our wants in an
uncultivated one. If this be cast upon me as a shame and a reproach, I
cheerfully bear it, for the remembrance never gives me any cause of
reproach or remorse.&#8221; Monsieur Perron, a commander sent out by the
French government to search for the unfortunate La Perouse (who had
recently perished in an exploratory voyage to the islands of the South
Pacific), visited Mr. Marsden&#8217;s farm in 1802,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span> and records, with the
generous admiration his countrymen have never withheld from English
enterprise and industry, his astonishment and delight. &#8220;No longer,&#8221; he
exclaims, &#8220;than eight years ago, the whole of this spot was covered with
immense and useless forests; what pains, what exertions must have been
employed! These roads, these pastures, these fields, these harvests,
these orchards, these flocks, the work of eight years!&#8221; And his
admiration of the scene was not greater than his reverence for its
owner, &#8220;who,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;while he thus laboured in his various important
avocations was not unmindful of the interests of others. He generously
interfered in behalf of the poorer settlers in their distresses,
established schools for their children, and often relieved their
necessities; and to the unhappy culprits, whom the justice of their
offended country had banished from their native soil, he administered
alternately exhortation and comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, it would be no easy task to enumerate all the schemes of social,
moral, and spiritual enterprise upon which Mr. Marsden was now employed,
and into all of which he appears to have thrown a force and energy which
is generally reserved, even by the zealous philanthropist, for some one
favoured project. Thus the state of the female convicts, at a very early
period, especially attracted his attention. Their forlorn condition,
their frightful immoralities&mdash;the almost necessary consequence of the
gross neglect which exposed them to temptation, or rather thrust them
into sin&mdash;pressed heavily upon him, and formed the subject of many
solemn remonstrances, first to the authorities abroad, and when these
were unheeded, to the government at home. The wrongs of the aborigines,
their<span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span> heathenism, and their savage state, with all its attendant
miseries and hopeless prospects in eternity, sank into his heart; and
under his care a school arose at Paramatta for their children. The
scheme, as we shall explain hereafter, was not successful; but at least
it will be admitted &#8220;he did well that it was in&#8221; his &#8220;heart.&#8221; He was
often consulted by the successive governors on questions of difficulty
and importance, and gave his advice with respect, but at the same time
with honest courage. Amusing anecdotes are told of some of their
interviews. A misunderstanding had occurred between Governor King and
himself, which did not, however, prevent the governor from asking his
advice. Mr. Marsden was allowed to make his own terms, which were that
he should consider Governor King as a private individual, and as such
address him. Much to his credit, the governor consented. Mr. Marsden
then locked the door, and in plain and forcible terms explained to
<i>Captain</i> King the faults, as he conceived, of <i>Governor</i> King&#8217;s
administration. They separated on the most friendly terms; and if we
admire the courage of the chaplain, we must not overlook the
self-command and forbearance of the governor. With a dash of
eccentricity the affair was honourable to both parties.</p>

<p>Another instance of Mr. Marsden&#8217;s ready tact and self-possession may be
mentioned. Governor King, who possessed, by virtue of his office, the
most absolute power, was not only eccentric but somewhat choleric. On
one occasion, when Mr. Marsden was present, a violent dispute arose
between the governor and the commissary-general. Mr. Marsden not being
at liberty to leave the room, retired to a window, determined not to be
a witness of the coming storm. The<span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span> governor, in his heat, pushed or
collared the commissary, who in return, pushed or struck the governor.
His excellency, indignant at the insult, called to the chaplain, &#8220;Do you
see that, sir!&#8221; &#8220;Indeed, sir,&#8221; replied Mr. M., &#8220;<i>I see</i>
nothing,&#8221;&mdash;dwelling with jocular emphasis on the word see. Thus good
humour was immediately restored, and the grave and even treasonable
offence of striking the representative of the sovereign was forgotten.
These trifling circumstances are worth relating, not only in
illustration of Mr. Marsden&#8217;s character, but of the history of the
earlier days of the colony.</p>

<p>But graver duties had already devolved upon him. Amongst the unpublished
manuscripts of the London Missionary Society, there is one document of
singular interest, in connexion with the name of Samuel Marsden. It is a
memorandum of seventeen folio pages on the state and prospects of their
missions to Tahiti and the islands in the South Seas, dated &#8220;Paramatta,
30th January, 1801,&#8221; and &#8220;read before the committee&#8221; in London&mdash;such was
the slow, uncertain communication fifty years ago with a colony now
brought within sixty days&#8217; sail of England&mdash;&#8220;on the 19th of April,
1802.&#8221; Foremost in the literature of another generation will stand those
treasures which slumber, for the most part unvalued and undisturbed, on
the shelves of our missionary houses. For men will surely one day
inquire, with an interest similar to that with which we read of the
conversion of Britain in the dim light of Ingulphus and the Saxon
Chronicle, or the venerable Bede, how distant islands were first
evangelized, and through what sorrows, errors, and reverses, the first
missionary fought his way to victory in continents and islands of the
southern hemisphere.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span> And of these, the document which now lies before
us will be esteemed as inferior to none in calm and practical wisdom, in
piety, or in ardent zeal tempered with discretion.</p>

<p>The circumstances which called it forth were these. The Tahitian
mission, the first great effort of the London Missionary Society, and
indeed the first Protestant mission, with perhaps one exception,<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> to
savage tribes, had hitherto disappointed the sanguine expectations of
its promoters. We trust we shall not be thought to make a display of
that cheap wisdom which consists in blaming the failures of which the
causes were not seen until the catastrophe had occurred, if we say that,
great and truly magnificent as the project was, it carried within itself
the elements of its own humiliation. The faith and zeal of its founders
were beyond all human praise; but in the wisdom which results from
experience, they were of course deficient. &#8220;To attempt great things, and
to expect great things,&#8221; was their motto; but they did not appreciate
the difficulties of the enterprise; nor did they duly estimate the depth
of the depravity of the savage heart and mind. Dr. Haweis, a London
clergyman of great piety and note in those days, preached before the
Society when the first missionary ship, the Duff, was about to sail. He
described to his delighted audience the romantic beauty and grandeur of
the islands which lie like emeralds upon the calm bosom of the Southern
Ocean, and anticipated their immediate conversion as soon as they should
hear the first glad tidings of the gospel. The ship sailed from the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span>Tower wharf, with flags flying and banners streaming, as if returning
from a triumph, amidst the cheers of the spectators. Amongst the crowd
there stood a venerable minister of Christ, leaning upon the arm of one
who still survives&mdash;himself a veteran in the service of his Lord. As
they turned slowly away from the exciting scene, the aged minister
mournfully exclaimed, &#8220;I am afraid it will not succeed: there is too
much of man in it.&#8221; His words were prophetic; for nearly twenty years no
success followed, but one sweeping tide of disappointment and
disaster;<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> till, at length, when, humbled and dejected, about the year
1814, the missionaries, as well as the Society at home, in despair had
almost resolved to abandon the station, the work of God appeared in the
conversion of the king of Tahiti; and with a rapidity to be compared
only to the long, cheerless, period in which they had &#8220;laboured in vain,
and spent their strength for nought,&#8221; the missionaries beheld not only
Tahiti, but the adjacent islands transformed into Christian lands.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of these disasters that Mr. Marsden was consulted,
and wrote the memorandum to which we have referred. If in some places he
seems to lay too great stress upon what may appear to the reader
prudential considerations of inferior importance, let us remind him that
on these very points the missionaries had betrayed their weakness. Their
own quarrels and even the gross misconduct of some few amongst them,
were not less painful to the church at home than their want of success.</p>

<p>We make a few extracts:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span>&#8220;... The first and principal object for the consideration of the
directors is to select men properly qualified for the mission; unless
persons equal to the task are sent out nothing can be done. It may be
asked, who are proper persons, and what are the requisite
qualifications? To the question I would reply in general terms. A
missionary should be a man of real sound piety, and well acquainted with
the depravity of the human heart, as well as experimental religion; he
should not be a novice; he should not only be a good man in the
strictest sense of the word, but also well informed, not taken from the
dregs of the common people, but possessed of some education, and liberal
sentiments. He should rather be of a lively active turn of mind than
gloomy and heavy. A gloomy ignorant clown will be disgusting even to
savages, and excite their contempt. The more easy and affable a
missionary is in his address, the more easily will he obtain the
confidence and good opinion of the heathen.</p>

<p>&#8220;In my opinion a man of a melancholy habit is altogether unqualified for
a missionary; he will never be able to sustain the hardships attending
his situation, nay, he will magnify his dangers and difficulties and
make them greater than what in reality they may be. A missionary, were I
to define his character, should be a pious good man, should be well
acquainted with mankind, should possess some education, should be easy
in address, and of an active turn. Some of the missionaries who have
come to this colony, are the opposite character to the above. They are
totally ignorant of mankind, they possess no education, they are clowns
in their manners. If the directors are determined to establish a mission
in these Islands there is another object to be attended<span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span> to; they must
send out a sufficient body and furnish them with the means of
self-defence. Unless the missionaries are able to protect themselves
from the violence of the natives, they will be in constant danger of
being cut off by them. Their lives, if unprotected by their own
strength, will hang sometimes perhaps upon the fate of a single battle
between two contending chiefs. Can any idea be more distressing than for
the lives of a few defenceless missionaries to depend upon the sudden
whim or turn of an enraged savage, without the means of self-defence?
See them driven, in order to escape the savage fury of the natives, into
holes and caverns of the rocks, suffering every hardship that nature can
bear from hunger, toil, and anxiety, without so much as the prospect of
relief in time of danger from Europe, or accomplishing in the smallest
degree the object of the mission. Yet this must and will be the case,
unless the missionaries are furnished with the means of self-defence,
and are able to convince the natives of their superiority in point of
skill and protection.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Many will condemn this counsel. Nor do we feel bound to justify it to
the letter. A reasonable degree of caution in avoiding danger, and under
great emergency in preparing measures for self-defence, may be allowed
even to the missionary. Yet experience shows that his safety chiefly
lies in cultivating and exhibiting the spirit of Him who &#8220;suffered the
just for the unjust,&#8221; and &#8220;when led as a lamb to the slaughter, yet
opened not his mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Various prudential hints follow, on marriage and other delicate
subjects. The reader will smile to learn that fifty years ago it was a
question at missionary boards whether married men were not dis<span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>qualified
for missionary work. It was argued that their wives would be exposed to
ill-usage from the natives, and that they themselves would be diverted
by the anxieties or the comforts of home from their proper calling. Mr.
Marsden combats both of these objections. &#8220;It appears to me that a
married woman, coming along with her husband in the mission, would have
no extraordinary dangers to apprehend from the natives, and would, if a
prudent woman, prove the greatest comfort and protection to her husband,
sweeten his toils and sustain his burdens.&#8221; Beyond this even Mr.
Marsden&#8217;s views did not yet extend. The time had not yet come when
experience should drive the friends of missions, in the failure of many
a plausible theory, to fall back simply on the New Testament, not merely
for their principles, for this they did, but for the best and safest
precedents in missionary work. They forgot how large a share of the
honours of the primitive church in its labours for Christ belong to the
weaker sex. That a missionary&#8217;s wife might be no less, nay in some
instances far more, successful than her husband was a thought not yet
entertained in missionary counsels. They did not foresee that the
instruction of the native woman, and the Christian education of the
heathen child, would soon become the special province of the
missionary&#8217;s wife. Mrs. Wilson had not yet arisen &#8220;a mother in Israel,&#8221;
nor Mrs. Judson, nor others whose fame is only less in missionary
annals, because their work has been carried on in places less
interesting, or at least less open to the world&#8217;s gaze, than Calcutta
and Burmah. Nor can we give more than a hesitating and partial consent
to some of the following observations:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span>&#8220;Civilization must pave the way for the conversion of the heathen. As
the natives in these islands are totally unconnected with the commercial
world, however friendly disposed they may be towards strangers, they
are, nevertheless, in a state of gross ignorance and barbarity. They
must, from their social situation, their great distance from the
civilized part of the world, be less prepared to receive the gospel than
the Esquimaux on the coast of Labrador or the negroes in the West Indian
Islands, and other parts of the heathen world where the Moravians in
general send their missionaries. The heathens in these islands are, in
the strictest sense, in a state of nature. Hence it becomes the
indispensable duty of the missionaries to use every means for their
civilization, and not to imagine they are already prepared to receive
the blessings of Divine revelation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>True, they were not prepared. But here we are at variance alike with Dr.
Haweis on the one hand, and Mr. Marsden on the other. &#8220;The preparation
of the heart,&#8221; the wise man tells us, &#8220;is from the Lord;&#8221; and this is a
kind of preparation which civilization will not supply. It is easy, as
we have said, to find fault with men who, whatever their mistakes,
deserve the veneration of the church. Let it be borne in mind that of
savage life, its horrors, its ferocity, its cannibalism, England then
knew but little. Had they been favoured with the experience we now
possess, they would have felt more deeply how impotent a weapon is
civilization to hew down the strongholds of Satan in a heathen land;
their failures perhaps would have been fewer, and their successes more
speedy if not more complete. A true Christian missionary, amongst
savages, must be of necessity a civilizer. His own pure and quiet
homestead, adorned with the arts<span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span> of life, his cultivated garden, his
neatly fenced paddock, the corn-field which soon follows, and then the
mill&mdash;all these, and, we may say, all the habits and circumstances of
his life, directly tend to civilize; and thus the process of outward
reformation goes on amongst the surrounding tribes, while the spiritual
seed is being sown in the native heart. And it will sometimes happen
that native tribes are civilized before they are converted, simply
because the carnal mind rejects the spiritual lesson, while selfishness,
or the mere love of imitation, (equally powerful in the breast of
children and of savages) induces them readily to adopt European habits.
But after all we question whether the native heathen thus outwardly
changed is one whit more likely to embrace the gospel than before.</p>

<p>There is, however, much truth in the following remarks; they show a
thoughtful mind, and they prove too, if we are not mistaken, that the
gospel of Jesus Christ has lost nothing of its pristine force after the
lapse of eighteen centuries; for the Christian missions of our own day
have triumphed amidst some difficulties against which even the apostles
had not to contend. &#8220;The conduct of the apostles cannot exactly apply as
a guide to the missionaries in these islands; St. Paul was sent to
preach a crucified Jesus, not to savage, but to civilized heathens; to
Greece and Rome, to nations noted for their politeness of manners and
human learning, the inhabitants both of Greece and Rome had obtained the
highest degree of civilization, they were&#8221;&mdash;intellectually, of course,
Mr. Marsden must be understood to mean&mdash;&#8220;prepared for the reception of
the gospel; their philosophers had for ages been making diligent
inquiries after the true God; they had erected altars and the most
magnificent<span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span> temples for the worship of some superior being whom they
knew not. This is not the case with the natives of these islands.... It
is unnecessary for me to contrast the situations of the primitive
apostles and the present missionaries, and to point out their vast
difference. Sacred and profane history will furnish the missionaries
with this information, provided they will study their records.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Marsden continued to be through life the confidential adviser of the
London Missionary Society, and the warm friend and, as they passed to
and fro upon their voyages, the kind host of their missionaries.</p>

<p>His character was now established. The colony was rapidly increasing in
importance; and yet no change had been made in its government, which was
still committed to the absolute direction of a single mind, that of the
colonial governor. He too was a military officer, and not always one of
high position and large capacity, or even of the purest morals; for by
such men the governorship of his Majesty&#8217;s territory in New South Wales
would have then been disdained. Mr. Marsden had done much, but much more
remained to be accomplished. There were mischiefs that lay far beyond
his reach, and spurned control. On the first establishment of the colony
all the military officers were forbidden to take their wives with
them&mdash;the governor and chaplains were the only exceptions&mdash;and there is
one instance of a lady whose love to her husband led her to steal across
the ocean in the disguise of a sailor, who was actually sent home again
by Governor Phillip without being permitted to land. Our readers may
anticipate the consequences which followed in an almost universal
licentiousness. The most abandoned females often appeared fearlessly<span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span>
before the magistrates, well knowing that they would have impunity even
for the greatest crimes; and male offenders used their influence to
obtain a judgment in their favour. Expostulation, remonstrance, and
entreaty Mr. Marsden had tried in vain. &#8220;Of all existing spots in New
South Wales the court of judicature at Sydney,&#8221; it was publicly
affirmed, &#8220;was the most iniquitous and abandoned;&#8221; and at length a
rebellious spirit broke out, and the authority of the governor, even in
his military capacity, was at an end. The efforts of the faithful
chaplain were now thwarted at the fountain head, and his life was not
unfrequently in danger. Mr. Marsden&#8217;s sagacity fastened the conviction
on his mind that a crisis was at hand, which could only be averted by
the interference of the government at home. He therefore asked for, and
obtained, permission to revisit England. His fears were just; he had
already assisted in quelling one rebellion, and another of a more
serious nature broke out soon after he embarked, which drove the
governor from the colony, and ended in his recall, and the establishment
of a new order of things. The spiritual fruit of Mr. Marsden&#8217;s labours
had not yet been great, but already the foundations had been laid for
extensive usefulness. On the eve of his departure, he was presented with
a gratifying address, bearing the signatures of three hundred and two
persons, &#8220;the holders of landed estates, public offices, and other
principal inhabitants of the large and extensive settlements of
Hawkesbury, Nepean, and Portland-Head, and adjacent parts of New South
Wales,&#8221; conveying &#8220;their grateful thanks for his pious, humane, and
exemplary conduct throughout this whole colony, in the various and
arduous situations held by him as a<span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span> minister of the gospel,
superintendent magistrate, inspector of public, orphan, and charity
schools, and in other offices.&#8221; They thank him too for &#8220;his attention
and cares in the improvement of stock, agriculture, and in all other
beneficial and useful arts, for the general good of the colony, and for
his unremitting exertions for its prosperity,&#8221; and conclude thus:&mdash;&#8220;Your
sanctity, philanthropy, and disinterestedness of character, will ever
remain an example to future ministers; and that God, whom we serve, may
pour down his blessings upon you and yours to the latest posterity, is
the sincere prayer of those who sign this address.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<blockquote><p>Various measures devised for the benefit of New South Wales&mdash;The
establishment of Missions in New Zealand&mdash;Friendship with Dr.
Mason Good.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Marsden returned home in His Majesty&#8217;s ship Buffalo, after an
absence of fourteen years. On the voyage he had one of those
hair-breadth deliverances in which devout Christians recognise the hand
of God. The Buffalo was leaky when she sailed, and a heavy gale
threatening, it was proposed that the passengers should quit the ship
and take refuge in a stauncher vessel which formed one of the fleet. Mr.
Marsden objected, Mrs. Marsden being unwilling to leave Mrs. King, the
wife of Governor King, who was returning in the same vessel, and who was
at the time an invalid. In the night, the expected storm came on. In the
morning, the eyes of all on board the crazy Buffalo were strained in
vain to discover their companion. She was never heard of more, and no
doubt had foundered in the hurricane.</p>

<p>On his arrival in London he waited on the under secretary of state to
report his return, and learned from him that his worst fears had been
realized, and that the colony was already in a state of open
insurrection, headed by the &#8220;New South Wales Corps,&#8221; who were leagued
with several of the wealthier traders. The insurrection was, however,
suppressed, and Lieut.-colonel Macquarie was sent out with his regiment
to assume the government. Lord Castlereagh, the colonial minister, was
quick to perceive the value of such an adviser on the affairs of
Australia as Mr.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span> Marsden, and encouraged him to lay before the
government a full statement of his views. Seldom has it happened to a
private individual to be charged with weightier or more various affairs,
never perhaps with schemes involving more magnificent results. As the
obscure chaplain from Botany Bay paced the Strand, from the colonial
office at Whitehall to the chambers in the city where a few pious men
were laying plans for Christian missions in the southern hemisphere, he
was in fact charged with projects upon which not only the civilization,
but the eternal welfare, of future nations were suspended. Nor was he
unconscious of the greatness of the task. With a total absence of
romance or enthusiasm&mdash;for his mind was wanting in the imaginative
faculty on which enthusiasm feeds&mdash;he was yet fully alive to the
possible consequences of his visit to his native shores, and intensely
interested in his work. He aimed at nothing less than to see Australia a
great country; and, with a yet firmer faith, he expected the conversion
of the cannibal tribes of New Zealand and the Society Islands; and this
at a time when even statesmen had only learned to think of New South
Wales as a national prison, and when the conversion of New Zealanders
was regarded as a hopeless task, even by the majority of Christian men,
and treated by the world with indifference or scorn. In fact, during
this short visit he may be said to have planned, perhaps unconsciously,
the labours of his whole life, and to have laid the foundation for all
the good of which he was to be the instrument.</p>

<p>Let us first turn to the efforts he made for the settlements in New
South Wales. The improvement of the convict population was his primary
object, and his more immediate duty. He had observed that by far<span class="pagenum">[Pg 49]</span> the
greater number of reformed criminals consisted of those who had
intermarried, or whose wives had been able to purchase their passage
over, and he suggested that those of the convicts&#8217; wives who chose to do
so should be permitted to accompany their husbands even at the public
expense. This was refused, and it was almost the only point upon which
his representations failed; but, as a compromise, the wives of the
officers and soldiers were permitted to accompany their husbands, and
not less than three hundred immediately went with a single regiment. To
encourage honesty and industry he recommended not only remission of the
sentence to the well conducted convict, but a grant of land to a certain
extent; with which the government complied. But he had no weak and
foolish sympathy with crime, and long after the period at which we are
now writing, he continued to incur the hatred of a certain class by
protesting, as he never ceased to do, against the monstrous impropriety
of placing men, however wealthy, who had themselves been convicts, on
the magisterial bench. Amongst the convicts he had observed that the
greater number were acquainted with some branch of mechanics or
manufactures; at present, they were unemployed, or occupied in labour
for which they were unfit, and which was therefore irksome to themselves
and of no advantage to the colony. He therefore suggested that one or
two practical mechanics with small salaries, and one or two general
manufacturers, should be sent out to instruct the convicts. But here a
serious obstacle presented itself; for this was the age of commercial
prohibitions, and it was objected that the manufacturers of the mother
country would be injured by such a step. Mr. Marsden met the objec<span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span>tion
at once. If the government would but accede to the proposal, &#8220;he would
undertake that the enormous expense at which the country was for
clothing the convicts should entirely cease within a certain period.&#8221;
The wool of the government flocks and the flesh of the wild cattle was
already sufficient to provide both food and raiment for the convicts
without any expense to the parent state, and all he prayed for was, the
opportunity of turning those advantages to the best account. These
requests were granted, and on the same night, and at his own cost, he
set off by the mail for Warwickshire and Yorkshire in search of four
artisans and manufacturers, who were soon upon their way to the scene of
their future operations.</p>

<p>The vast importance of Australia as the source on which the English
manufacturer must at some future day depend for his supplies of wool,
had already occupied his thoughts. He found that within three years his
own stock without any care on his part, (for his farm was entirely
managed in his absence by a trusty bailiff who had been a convict,) had
upon an average been doubled in number and value. With the energy which
was natural to him, he carried some of his own wool to Leeds, where he
had it manufactured, and he had the satisfaction to learn that it was
considered equal, if not superior, to that of Saxony or France. His
private letters abound with intimations that ere long Australia must
become the great wool-producing country to which the English
manufacturer would look. He was introduced to king George the Third, and
took the liberty, through Sir Joseph Banks, of praying for a couple of
Merino sheep, His Majesty&#8217;s property, to improve the breed; and his last
letter from England, dated from the Cowes Roads, mentions<span class="pagenum">[Pg 51]</span> their
reception on board. We anticipate a little, but must quote the letter,
were it only to let the reader see how possible it is to be at once
diligent in business and fervent in spirit. &#8220;We are this moment getting
under weigh, and soon expect to be upon the ocean. I have received a
present of five Spanish sheep from the king&#8217;s flock, which are all on
board; if I am so fortunate as to get them out they will be a most
valuable acquisition to the colony. I leave England with much
satisfaction, having obtained so fully the object of my mission. It is
the good hand of our God that hath done these things for us. I have the
prospect of getting another pious minister. I am writing to him on the
subject this morning, and I hope he will soon follow us.... On Sunday I
stood on the long boat and preached from Ezekiel xviii. 27: &#8216;When the
wicked man turneth away,&#8217; etc. It was a solemn time, many of the
convicts were affected. We sang the Hundredth Psalm in the midst of a
large fleet. The number of souls on board is more than four hundred. God
may be gracious to some of them; though exiled from their country and
friends, they may cry unto him in a foreign land, when they come like
the Jews of old to hang their harps upon the willows, and weep when they
remember Zion, or rather when they remember England.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p>The spiritual wants of the colony were not forgotten. He induced the
government to send out three additional clergymen and three
schoolmasters; and happily the selection was intrusted to his own
judgment. A disciple in the school of Venn and Milner, he knew that the
ordinances of the church, though administered by a moral and virtuous
man, or by a zealous philan<span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span>thropist, were not enough. He sought for men
who were &#8220;renewed in the spirit of their minds;&#8221; who uttered no mere
words of course when they said at their ordination that they &#8220;believed
themselves moved thereto by the Holy Ghost.&#8221; But here again his task was
difficult; clergymen of such a stamp were but few; the spirit of
missionary enterprise was almost unfelt; and, to say the truth, there
was a missionary field at home, dark and barbarous, and far too wide for
the few such labourers of this class whom the Lord had yet &#8220;sent forth
into his harvest.&#8221; Mr. Marsden, however, nothing daunted, went from
parish to parish till he met with two admirable men, the Rev. Mr. Cowper
and the Rev. Robert Cartwright, who, with their families, accompanied
him on his return. His choice was eminently successful. In a short
account of Mr. Marsden, published in Australia in 1844, they are spoken
of as still living, pious and exemplary clergymen, the fathers of
families occupying some of the most important posts in the colony, and,
&#8220;notwithstanding their advancing years and increasing infirmities,&#8221; it
is added, &#8220;there are few young men in the colony so zealous in preaching
the gospel, and in promoting the interests of the church of England.&#8221;
The schoolmasters too, we believe, did honour to his choice. He had
already established two public free-schools for children of both sexes,
and he was now able to impart the elements of a pious education, and to
train them in habits of industry and virtue. Into all these plans the
archbishop of Canterbury cordially entered, and wisely and liberally
left it to the able founder to select his agents and associates.</p>

<p>Mr. Marsden likewise urged upon the home administration the necessity of
a female Penitentiary; and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span> obtained a promise that a building should be
provided. That he was deeply alive to the importance of an institution
of this kind, is manifest in his own description of the state of the
female prisoners in the earlier years of the colony, and the deplorable
picture he draws of their immorality and wretchedness. &#8220;When I returned
to England in 1807,&#8221; he says, &#8220;there were upwards of fourteen hundred
women in the colony; more than one thousand were unmarried, and nearly
all convicts: many of them were exposed to the most dangerous
temptations, privations and sufferings; and no suitable asylum had been
provided for the female convicts since the establishment of the colony.
On my arrival in London in 1808, I drew up two memorials on their
behalf, stating how much they suffered from want of a proper barrack&mdash;a
building for their reception. One of these memorials I presented to the
under secretary of state, and the other to his grace the archbishop of
Canterbury. They both expressed their readiness to promote the object.&#8221;
Years, however, passed before the consent of the colonial governor could
be gained; and Mr. Marsden&#8217;s benevolent exertions on behalf of these
outcast women were for some time frustrated.</p>

<p>The variety of his engagements at this time was equal to their
importance. He had returned home charged with an almost infinite
multiplicity of business. He was the agent of almost every poor person
in the colony who had, or thought he had, important business at home.
Penny-postages lay in the same dim future with electric telegraphs and
steam-frigates, and he was often burdened with letters from Ireland and
other remote parts (so wrote a friend, who published at the time a
sketch of his proceedings in the &#8220;Eclectic<span class="pagenum">[Pg 54]</span> Review,&#8221;) the postage of
which, for a single day, has amounted to a guinea; which he cheerfully
paid, from the feeling that, although many of these letters were of no
use whatever, they were written with a good intention, and under a
belief that they were of real value. He had already been saluted, like
the Roman generals of old, with the title of common father of his
adopted country; and one of his last acts before he quitted England, was
to procure, by public contributions and donations of books, &#8220;what he
called a lending library&#8221; (so writes the reviewer,<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> and the expression
seems to have amused him from its novelty), &#8220;consisting of books on
religion, morals, mechanics, agriculture, and general history, to be
lent out under his own control and that of his colleagues, to soldiers,
free settlers, convicts, and others who had time to read.&#8221; In this, too,
he succeeded, and took over with him a library of the value of between
three and four hundred pounds.</p>

<p>It was during this two-years&#8217;-visit to his native land, that Mr. Marsden
laid the foundation of the Church of England mission to New Zealand. In
its consequences, civil and religious, this has already proved one of
the most extraordinary and most successful of those achievements, which
are the glory of the churches in these later times. This was the great
enterprise of his life: he is known already, and will be remembered
while the church on earth endures, as the apostle of New Zealand. Not
that we claim for him the exclusive honour of being the only one
although we believe he was, in point of time, the first who began, about
this period, to project a mission to New Zealand. The Wesleyans were
early in the same <span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span>field. The Rev. Samuel Leigh, a man whose history and
natural character bore a marked resemblance to those of Mr. Marsden, was
the pioneer of Methodism, and proved himself a worthy herald of the
cross amongst the New Zealanders. A warm friendship existed between the
two. On his passage homewards he was a guest at Paramatta; and no tinge
of jealousy ever appears to have shaded their intercourse, each
rejoicing in the triumphs of the other. Still, Mr. Marsden&#8217;s position
afforded him peculiar facilities, and having once undertaken it, the
superintendence of the New Zealand mission became, without design on his
part, the great business of his life.</p>

<p>He had formed a high, we do not think an exaggerated, estimate of the
Maori or New Zealand tribes. &#8220;They are a noble race,&#8221; he writes to his
friend John Terry, Esq., of Hull, &#8220;vastly superior in understanding to
anything you can imagine in a savage nation.&#8221; This was before the
mission was begun. But he did not speak merely from hearsay: several of
their chieftains and enterprising warriors had visited Australia, and
they ever found a welcome at the hospitable parsonage at Paramatta.
Sometimes, it is true, they were but awkward guests, as the following
anecdote will show; which we present to the reader, as it has been
kindly furnished to us, in the words of one of Mr. Marsden&#8217;s daughters.
&#8220;My father had sometimes as many as thirty New Zealanders staying at the
parsonage. He possessed extraordinary influence over them. On one
occasion, a young lad, the nephew of a chief, died, and his uncle
immediately made preparations to sacrifice a slave to attend his spirit
into the other world. Mr. M. was from home at the moment, and his family
were only able to preserve the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span> life of the young New Zealander by
hiding him in one of the rooms. Mr. M. no sooner returned and reasoned
with the chief, than he consented to spare his life. No further attempt
was made upon it, though the uncle frequently deplored that his nephew
had no attendant in the next world, and seemed afraid to return to New
Zealand, lest the father of the young man should reproach him for having
given up this, to them, important point.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Church Missionary Society, which had now been established about
seven years, seemed fully disposed to co-operate with him; and at their
request he drew up a memorial on the subject of a New Zealand mission,
not less important than that we have already mentioned, to the London
Missionary Society, on the subject of their Polynesian missions. He
still lays great stress upon the necessity of civilization going first
as the pioneer of the gospel; &#8220;commerce and the arts having a natural
tendency to inculcate industrious and moral habits, open a way for the
introduction of the gospel, and lay the foundation for its continuance
when once received&#8221; &#8220;... Nothing, in my opinion, can pave the way for
the introduction of the gospel but civilization.&#8221; ... &#8220;The
missionaries,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;might employ a certain portion of their time
in manual labour, and that this neither would nor ought to prevent them
from constantly endeavouring to instruct the natives in the great
doctrines of the gospel.&#8221; ... &#8220;The arts and religion should go together.
I do not mean a native should learn to build a hut or make an axe before
he should be told anything of man&#8217;s fall and redemption, but that these
grand subjects should be introduced at every favourable opportunity,
while the natives are learning any of the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span> simple arts.&#8221; He adds that
&#8220;four qualifications are absolutely necessary for a missionary&mdash;piety,
industry, prudence, and patience. Without sound piety, nothing can be
expected. A man must feel a lively interest in the eternal welfare of
the heathen to spur him on to the discharge of his duty.&#8221; On the three
other qualifications, he enlarges with great wisdom and practical good
sense; but the paper has been frequently printed, and we must not
transfer it to these pages.</p>

<p>It is no dishonour done to Mr. Marsden if we say that, in mature
spiritual wisdom, the venerable men who had founded the Church
Missionary Society, and still managed its affairs, were at this time his
superiors. Strange indeed it would have been had the case been
otherwise. They listened gratefully and with deep respect to the opinion
of one so well entitled to advise; they determined on the mission, and
they gave a high proof of their confidence, both in the practical wisdom
and sterling piety of their friend, in consulting him in the choice of
their first agents. But they did not adopt his views with regard to the
importance of civilization as the necessary pioneer to the gospel. So
long ago as the year 1815, they thought it necessary to publish a
statement of the principles upon which their mission was established.
&#8220;It has been stated,&#8221; they say, &#8220;that the mission was originally
established, and for a long time systematically conducted, on the
principle of first civilizing and then christianizing the natives. This
is wholly a mistake. The agents employed in establishing the mission
were laymen, because clergymen could not be had; and the instructions
given to them necessarily correspond with their lay character. The
foremost object of the mission has, from the first, been to bring the
natives, by the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 58]</span> use of all suitable means, under the saving influences
of the grace of the gospel, adding indeed the communication to them of
such useful arts and knowledge as might improve their social condition.&#8221;
The committee&#8217;s instructions to their first agents in the mission
abundantly sustain these assertions. Mr. William Hall and Mr. John King
were the two single-hearted laymen to whom, in the providence of God,
the distinguished honour was committed of first making known the gospel
in New Zealand. They bore with them these instructions, ere they
embarked in the same vessel in which their friend and guide Mr. Marsden
himself returned to Australia:&mdash;&#8220;Ever bear in mind that the only object
of the Society, in sending you to New Zealand, is to introduce the
knowledge of Christ among the natives, and in order to this, the arts of
civilized life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then after directing Messrs. Hall and King &#8220;to respect the sabbath day,&#8221;
to &#8220;establish family worship,&#8221; at any favourable opportunity to
&#8220;converse with the natives on the great subject of religion,&#8221; and to
&#8220;instruct their children in the knowledge of Christianity,&#8221; the
instructions add&mdash;&#8220;Thus in your religious conduct you must observe the
sabbath and keep it holy, attend regularly to family worship, talk to
the natives about religion when you walk by the way, when you labour in
the field, and on all occasions when you can gain their attention, and
lay yourselves out for the education of the young.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Kendall followed; a third layman, for no ordained clergyman
of the church of England could yet be found. The same instructions were
repeated, and in December, 1815, when the Rev. John<span class="pagenum">[Pg 59]</span> Butler, their first
clerical missionary, entered on his labours in New Zealand, he and his
companions were exhorted thus&mdash;&#8220;The committee would observe that they
wish, in all the missions of the Society, that the missionaries should
give their time as much as possible, and wholly if practicable, first to
the acquisition of the native language, and then to the constant and
faithful preaching to the natives.&#8221; It is subsequently added&mdash;&#8220;Do not
mistake civilization for conversion. Do not imagine when heathens are
raised in intellect, in the knowledge of the arts and outward decencies,
above their fellow-countrymen, that they are Christians, and therefore
rest content as if your proper work were accomplished. Our great aim is
far higher; it is to make them children of God and heirs of his glory.
Let this be your desire, and prayer, and labour among them. And while
you rejoice in communicating every other good, think little or nothing
done till you see those who were dead in trespasses and sins, quickened
together with Christ.&#8221; These passages fully exhibit the views of the
committee of this evangelical Society with regard, not only to the New
Zealand, but to all their other missions. Nor do they stand alone; every
missionary association, taught in many instances by bitter
disappointment, has long since discovered that the arts and sciences do
not prepare the way of the Lord amongst the heathen abroad; just as they
leave unsanctified our civilized heathendom at home.</p>

<p>But we must return from our digression, which its great importance must
excuse.</p>

<p>Before he left England, Mr. Marsden formed or renewed an acquaintance
with many great and good men, Mr. Wilberforce, Sir George Grey, the Rev.
Daniel Wilson, late Bishop of Calcutta, the Rev. Charles<span class="pagenum">[Pg 60]</span> Simeon, the
Rev. Josiah Pratt, Dr. Olinthus Gregory, and others whose names are dear
to the church of Christ. But we must particularly notice the friendship
which he formed with Dr. Mason Good as productive of the highest
blessings to his friend, and of much advantage to himself.</p>

<p>The life of this excellent and accomplished person was published by Dr.
Olinthus Gregory, soon after his death, in 1828. He tells us that Dr.
Mason Good, when he became acquainted with Mr. Marsden, had long
professed Socinian principles, but of these had recently begun to doubt,
while he had not yet embraced the gospel of Christ so as to derive
either comfort or strength from it. He was anxious and inquiring; his
father had been an orthodox dissenting minister, and he himself a
constant student and indeed a critical expositor of the Bible. He had
published a translation of the book of Job, with notes, and also a
translation of Solomon&#8217;s Song of Songs. He saw in the latter a sublime
and mystic allegory, and in the former a poem, than which nothing can be
purer in its morality, nothing sublimer in its philosophy, nothing more
majestic in its creed. He had given beautiful translations of many of
the Psalms; but with all this he had not yet perceived that Christ is
the great theme of the Old Testament, nor did he understand the
salvation of which &#8220;David in the Psalms, and all the prophets,&#8221; as well
as Job the patriarch &#8220;did speak.&#8221; His introduction to Mr. Marsden, in
such a state of mind, was surely providential. He saw, and wondered at,
his self-denial; he admired the true sublimity of his humble,
unassuming, but unquestionable and active piety. &#8220;The first time I saw
Mr. Marsden,&#8221; says his biographer, &#8220;was in January, 1808; he had just<span class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span>
returned from Hull, and had travelled nearly the whole journey on the
outside of a coach in a heavy fall of snow, being unable to secure an
inside place. He seemed scarcely conscious of the inclemency of the
season, and declared that he felt no inconvenience from the journey. He
had accomplished his object, and that was enough. And what was that
object, which could raise him above the exhaustion of fatigue and the
sense of severe cold? He had engaged a rope-maker who was willing, at
his (Mr. Marsden&#8217;s) own expense, to go and teach his art to the New
Zealanders.&#8221; So writes Dr. Olinthus Gregory.</p>

<p>As a philosopher who loved to trace phenomena to their causes, Dr. Mason
Good endeavoured to ascertain the principles from which these
unremitting exertions sprang; and, as he often assured his friend, Dr.
Gregory, he could trace them only to the elevating influence of Divine
grace. He could find no other clue; and he often repeated the wish that
his own motives were as pure, and his own conduct as exemplary as those
of Mr. Marsden. Thus light broke in, and at length he received the
gospel &#8220;as a little child,&#8221; and began to adorn it by his conduct. For
several years he was an efficient member of the committee of the Bible
Society, and of that of the Church Missionary Society. To the latter
especially he devoted himself with the utmost activity and ardour, and
at his death, which occurred in 1827, the committee transmitted to Mrs.
Good a resolution expressive of the very high value they set on his
services, and of the heavy loss they were conscious they sustained by
that event. The resolution was accompanied by a letter of cordial
sympathy from the pen of the Rev. Edward Bickersteth, the secretary.
When dying<span class="pagenum">[Pg 62]</span> he was, heard, without any suggestion or leading remark from
those around him, to repeat with quivering lips the text, &#8220;All the
promises of God in him (Christ Jesus) are Yea, and in him Amen.&#8221; &#8220;What
words,&#8221; said he, &#8220;for a dying man to rest upon!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<blockquote><p>Return to the Colony&mdash;Duaterra&mdash;His strange adventures&mdash;Mr.
Marsden&#8217;s Labours in New South Wales&mdash;Aborigines&mdash;Their
Habits&mdash;Plans for their Civilization.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Marsden took what proved to be his last leave of his native land in
August 1809. Resolute as he was, and nerved for danger, a shade of
depression passed across him. &#8220;The ship, I understand,&#8221; he writes to
Mrs. Mason Good, &#8220;is nearly ready. This land in which we live is
polluted, and cannot, on account of sin, give rest to any of its
inhabitants. Those who have (sought) and still do seek their happiness
in anything it can give, will meet nothing but disappointment, vexation,
and sorrow. If we have only a common share of human happiness, we cannot
have or hope for more.&#8221; A few weeks afterwards he addresses the same
Christian lady thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Cambridge, August 1, 1809.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yesterday I assisted my much esteemed friend, Mr. Simeon, but here I
shall have no continuing city. The signal will soon be given, the anchor
weighed, and the sails spread, and the ship compelled to enter the
mighty ocean to seek for distant lands. I was determined to take another
peep at Cambridge, though conscious I could but enjoy those beautiful
scenes for a moment. In a few days we shall set off for Portsmouth. All
this turning and wheeling about from place, to place, and from nation to
nation, I trust is our right way to the heavenly Canaan. I am happy in
the conclusion, to inform you that I have got all <span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span>my business settled
in London much to my satisfaction, both with government and in other
respects. The object of my mission has been answered, far beyond my
expectations. I believe that God has gracious designs towards New South
Wales, and that his gospel will take root there, and spread amongst the
heathen nations to the glory of his grace.</p>

<p class="quotsig">&#8220;I have the honour to be, dear madam,<br />
&#8220;Yours, in every Christian bond,<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Samuel Marsden</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>His prayers and devout aspirations for New Zealand had been heard on
high, and &#8220;the way of the Lord&#8221; was &#8220;preparing&#8221; in a manner far beyond
his expectations, ardent as they seem. The ship Ann, in which he sailed,
by order of the government, for New South Wales, carried with her one
whom Providence had raised up to act a part, only less important than
his own, in the conversion of that benighted land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 65]</span>The ship had been some time at sea before Mr. Marsden observed on the
forecastle, amongst the common sailors, a man whose darker skin and
wretched appearance awakened his sympathy. He was wrapped in an old
great coat, very sick and weak, had a violent cough, accompanied with
profuse bleeding. He was much dejected, and appeared as though a few
days would close his life. This was Duaterra, a New Zealand chieftain,
whose story, as related by Mr. Marsden himself, is almost too strange
for fiction. And as &#8220;this young chief became,&#8221; as he tells us, &#8220;one of
the principal instruments in preparing the way for the introduction of
the arts of civilization and the knowledge of Christianity into his
native country,&#8221; a brief sketch of his marvellous adventures will not be
out of place.</p>

<p>When the existence of New Zealand was yet scarcely known to Europeans,
it was occasionally visited by a South Sea whaler distressed for
provisions, or in want of water. One of these, the Argo, put into the
Bay of Islands in 1805, and Duaterra, fired with the spirit of
adventure, embarked on board with two of his companions. The Argo
remained on the New Zealand coast for above five months, and then sailed
for Port Jackson, the modern Sydney of Australia, Duaterra sailing with
her. She then went to fish on the coast of New Holland for six months,
again returning to Port Jackson. Duaterra had been six months on board,
working in general as a common sailor, and passionately fond of this
roving life. He then experienced that unkindness and foul play of which
the New Zealander has always had sad reason to complain. He was left on
shore without a friend and without the slightest remuneration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 66]</span>He now shipped himself on board the Albion whaler, Captain Richardson,
whose name deserves honourable mention; he behaved very kindly to
Duaterra, repaid him for his services in various European articles, and
after six months cruising on the fisheries, put him on shore in the Bay
of Islands, where his tribe dwelt. Here he remained six months, when the
Santa Anna anchored in the bay, on her way to Norfolk Island and other
islets of the South Sea in quest of seal skins. The restless Duaterra
again embarked; he was put on shore on Norfolk Island at the head of a
party of fourteen sailors, provided with a very scanty supply of water,
bread, and salt provisions, to kill seals, while the ship sailed,
intending to be absent but a short time, to procure potatoes and pork in
New Zealand. On her return she was blown off the coast in a storm, and
did not make the land for a month. The sealing party were now in the
greatest distress, and accustomed as he was to hardship, Duaterra often
spoke of the extreme suffering which he and his party had endured,
while, for upwards of three months, they existed on a desert island with
no other food than seals and sea fowls, and no water except when a
shower of rain happened to fall. Three of his companions, two Europeans
and one Tahitian, died under these distresses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span>At length the Santa Anna returned, having procured a valuable cargo of
seal skins, and prepared to take her departure homewards. Duaterra had
now an opportunity of gratifying an ardent desire he had for some time
entertained of visiting that remote country from which so many vast
ships were sent, and to see with his own eyes the great chief of so
wonderful a people. He willingly risked the voyage, as a common sailor,
to visit England and see king George. The Santa Anna arrived in the
river Thames about July 1809, and Duaterra now requested that the
captain would make good his promise, and indulge him with at least a
sight of the king. Again he had a sad proof of the perfidiousness of
Europeans. Sometimes he was told that no one was allowed to see king
George; sometimes that his house could not be found. This distressed him
exceedingly; he saw little of London, was ill-used, and seldom permitted
to go on shore. In about fifteen days, the vessel had discharged her
cargo, when the captain told him that he should put him on board the
Ann, which had been taken up by government to convey convicts to New
South Wales. The Ann had already dropped down to Gravesend, and Duaterra
asked the master of the Santa Anna for some wages and clothing. He
refused to give him any, telling him that the owners at Port Jackson
would pay him in two muskets for his services on his arrival there; but
even these he never received.</p>

<p>Mr. Marsden was at this time in London, quite ignorant of the fact that
the son of a New Zealand chief, in circumstances so pitiable, lay on
board a South Sea whaler near London bridge. Their first meeting was on
board the Ann, as we have stated, when she had been some days at sea.
His sympathies were at once roused, and his indignation too; for it was
always ill for the oppressor when he fell within the power of his stern
rebuke. &#8220;I inquired,&#8221; he says, &#8220;of the master where he met with him, and
also of Duaterra what had brought him to England, and how he came to be
so wretched and miserable. He told me that the hardships and wrongs
which he had endured on board the Santa Anna were exceedingly great, and
that the English sailors had beaten him very much, which was the cause
of his spitting blood, and that the master had defrauded him of all his
wages, and prevented his seeing the king. I should have been very happy,
if there had been time, to call the master of the Santa Anna to account
for his conduct, but it was too late. I endeavoured to soothe his
afflictions, and assured him that he should be protected from insults,
and that his wants should be supplied.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span>By the kindness of those on board, Duaterra recovered, and was ever
after truly grateful for the attention shown him. On their arrival at
Sydney, Mr. Marsden took him into his house for six months, during which
time he applied himself to agriculture; he then wished to return home,
and embarked for New Zealand; but further perils and adventures were in
prospect, and we shall have occasion to advert to them hereafter. For
the present we leave him on his voyage to his island home.</p>

<p>The Ann touched on her passage out at Rio Janeiro, and Mr. Marsden spent
a short time on shore, where his active mind, already, one would
suppose, burthened with cares and projects, discovered a new field of
labour. The ignorance and superstition of a popish city stirred his
spirit, like that of Paul at Athens. He wrote home to entreat the Church
Missionary Society, if possible, to send them teachers; but this lay not
within their province. From a letter of Sir George Grey&#8217;s, addressed to
himself, it appears that he had interested some members of the English
government upon the subject, and that while at Rio he had been active in
distributing the Scriptures.</p>

<p>But he was now to resume his labours in Australia, where he arrived in
safety, fondly calculating upon a long season of peaceful toil in his
heavenly Master&#8217;s service. His mind was occupied with various projects,
both for the good of the colony and of the heathen round about. His own
letters, simply and hastily thrown off in all the confidence of
friendship, will show how eagerly he plunged, and with what a total
absence of selfish considerations, into the work before him:</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Paramatta, October 26, 1810.</p>
<p>&#8220;To John Terry, Esq.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>.&mdash;I received your kind and affectionate letter, also a bottle
of wheat, with the Hull papers, from your brother; for all of which I
feel much indebted. We had a very fine passage, and I found my affairs
much better than I had any reason to expect. <span class="pagenum">[Pg 69]</span>The revolution had caused
much distress to many families, and the settlement has been thrown much
back by this event. My wishes for the general welfare of the colony have
been more successful than I expected they would be. The rising
generation are now under education in almost all parts of the country.
The Catholic priests have all left us, so that we have now the whole
field to ourselves. I trust much good will be done; some amongst us are
turning to the Lord. Our churches are well attended, which is promising
and encouraging to us. My colleagues are men of piety and four of the
schoolmasters. This will become a great country in time, it is much
favoured in its soil and climate. I am very anxious for the instruction
of the New Zealanders; they are a noble race, vastly superior in
understanding to anything you can imagine a savage nation could attain.
Mr. Hall, who was in Hull, and came out with us with an intention to
proceed to New Zealand as a missionary, has not yet proceeded, in
consequence of a melancholy difference between the natives of that
island and the crew of a ship called the &#8216;Boyd.&#8217; The ship was burnt, and
all the crew murdered; our people, it appears, were the first
aggressors, and dearly paid for their conduct towards the natives by the
loss of their lives and ship. I do not think that this awful event will
prevent the establishment of a mission at New Zealand. Time must be
allowed for the difference to be made up, and for confidence to be
restored. I wrote a letter to Mr. Hardcastle, and another to Rev. J.
Pratt, Secretary to the Society for Missions to Africa and the East, and
have pointed out to them the necessity of having a ship constantly
employed in visiting the islands in the South Seas, for the convenience,
safety, and protection <span class="pagenum">[Pg 70]</span>of the missionaries, either at Otaheite and New
Zealand, or at any other island upon which they may reside....</p>

<p class="quotsig">&#8220;Your&#8217;s respectfully,<br />
&#8220;(Signed) <span class="smcap">Samuel Marsden</span>.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>

<p>Great projects are not to be accomplished without many disappointments.
The first attempt is seldom the successful one. In spiritual things,
this may be regarded as the established rule, or law, in accordance to
which the Head of the church controls while he purifies his servants&#8217;
zeal. They are made to feel their weakness. Where they expect honour
they meet with opposition, perhaps with scorn. Their favourite plans are
those which bring, for a time, the least success and the greatest
anxiety. Thus they are taught the great lesson of their own weakness,
and the only less important one of the insignificance of others in whom
they trusted. And thus, too, in the painful but salutary school of
adversity, they learn that the highest wisdom is, after all, simply to
accept the cross of Christ, and to cast themselves on the unerring
guidance of the Holy Spirit; and, in a word, &#8220;to cease from man.&#8221;</p>

<p>The new governor, General Macquarie, had arrived out a few months before
Mr. Marsden. He was an able commander, and had the good of the colony
much at heart; and he had a task of no little difficulty to perform, in
reducing what was still a penal colony, just recovering from a state of
insurrection, into order and obedience. His powers were great; he
considered them absolute. Mr. Marsden, too, was justly tenacious of
public morality and virtue, and still more so of the spiritual
independence of the ministerial cha<span class="pagenum">[Pg 71]</span>racter. It seems that the rights of
the governor on the one side, and those of the ministers of religion on
the other, had not been accurately defined by the government at home,
and thus a collision between two minds so firm and so resolute as those
of the governor and Mr. Marsden, was inevitable. Occasions of difference
soon arose; the governor anxious, we doubt not, to raise their character
and elevate their position, with a view to the future welfare of the
colony, placed several of the convicts on the magisterial bench, treated
them with respect, and even invited them to his table. With these men,
Mr. Marsden refused, as a magistrate, to act, or to meet them in society
on equal terms. Some of them were notoriously persons of a bad and
vicious life; while none of them, he thought, could, without gross
impropriety, punish others judicially for the infraction of that law
which they themselves had broken. He would gladly have resigned his
magisterial office, but the governor knew the worth of his services, and
refused to accept his resignation, which was repeatedly tendered. The
new magistrates were of course offended, and became his bitter foes; and
some of them harassed him for twenty years with slanders and libellous
insults, until at length an appeal to the laws of his country vindicated
his reputation and silenced his opponents. Differences of opinion may
exist as to the wisdom of Governor Macquarie&#8217;s conduct in these civil
affairs, and many will perhaps justify his proceedings; but every
right-minded man will condemn without hesitation the attempts which he
made to lord it over the consciences of the established clergy and other
Christian ministers in the colony, in the discharge of their purely
ministerial work. He wished<span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span> to dictate even to the pulpit. Mr. Marsden
relates that he once sent for him to the Government-house, and commanded
him to produce the manuscript of a sermon which he had preached nearly a
year before: he did so; when the governor severely commented upon it,
and returned it with the remark that one sentence, which it is more than
probable he did not understand, was &#8220;almost downright blasphemy.&#8221; The
junior clergy were of course still more exposed to the same despotic
interference. The governor wished to prescribe the hymns they should
sing, as well as the doctrines they should teach; and he repeatedly
insisted on their giving out, during divine service, secular notices of
so improper a character, that the military officers in attendance
expressed their disgust. Happy it was for the colony of New South Wales
that he met with an opponent firm and fearless, and at the same time
sound in the faith, such as the senior chaplain. On him menaces and
flattery were lost. The governor, at one time, even threatened him with
a court-martial; nor was the threat altogether an empty one, for he
actually brought one of the junior chaplains, Mr. Vale, before a
court-martial, and had him dismissed the colony. These are painful
facts, and such as, at this distance of time, we should gladly pass over
in silence; but, in that case, what could the reader know of the trials
through which Mr. Marsden passed?</p>

<p>Yet amidst all these distractions his letters testify that he possessed
his soul in peace, and that &#8220;no root of bitterness, troubled&#8221; him. He
speaks with respect of the governor, gives him credit for good
intentions, and acknowledges the many benefits he conferred upon the
colony; and when at length he was on the eve of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 73]</span> returning home,
Governor Macquarie himself bore testimony to the piety, integrity, and
invaluable services of the only man who had dared patiently yet firmly
to contend with him during a long course of years.</p>

<p>The records of ministerial life offer little variety, but to pious minds
they are not without interest. Mr. Marsden rose early, generally at four
o&#8217;clock during the summer; and the morning hours were spent in his
study. To a Christian minister a few hours of retirement in the morning
are indispensable, or the mind is distracted and the day is lost. Very
early rising is a question of health and constitution as well as of
conscience, and we lay no burden upon those who cannot practise it. To
those who can, the habit is invaluable. Three friends of Mr. Marsden
present us with different examples in this matter. Simeon&#8217;s twenty
volumes of Hor Homilic, or outlines of sermons, were all written
between five and eight o&#8217;clock in the morning. Thomas Scott, the
commentator, seldom had more than three hours a-day in his study and
those three were early ones. Wilberforce on the other hand laments that
he could do nothing till he had had his &#8220;full dose of sleep.&#8221; Those who
cannot rise early may still make the day long by turning to account the
fragments of time and vacant half-hours which are so recklessly
permitted by most men, especially strong men, to run to waste.</p>

<p>In the early days of the colony, Mr. Marsden used to officiate in the
morning at St. Philip&#8217;s, Sydney. Roads were bad and conveyances scarce,
and he often walked a distance of fifteen miles to Paramatta, where he
conducted another service and preached again. His preaching is described
as very plain, full of good<span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span> sense and manly thought, and treating
chiefly of the great foundation truths of the gospel. Man a lost sinner
and needing conversion, Christ an Almighty Saviour pardoning sin, the
Holy Ghost an all-sufficient sanctifier, guide, and comforter, carrying
on the work of grace within the soul. Those who came to hear a great
preacher went away disappointed; those who came to pass a listless hour
were sometimes grievously disturbed. The authenticity of the following
anecdote has been assured to us by Mr. Marsden&#8217;s surviving friends.</p>

<p>He was one day walking by the banks of the river, when a convict as he
passed plunged into the water. Mr. Marsden threw off his coat, and in an
instant plunged in after him and endeavoured to bring the man to land.
He contrived however to get Mr. Marsden&#8217;s head under the water, and a
desperate struggle for life ensued between them; till Mr. Marsden, being
the stronger of the two, not only succeeded in getting safe to shore but
in dragging the man with him. The poor fellow, struck with remorse,
confessed his intention. He had resolved to have his revenge on the
senior chaplain, whose offence was that he had preached a sermon which
had stung him to the quick; and he believed, as a sinner exasperated by
the reflection of his own vices does frequently believe, that the
preacher had meant to hold him up to the scorn of the congregation. He
knew too that the sight of a drowning fellow-creature would draw out the
instant help of one who never knew what fear was in the discharge of
duty; and he threw himself into the stream confident of drowning Mr.
Marsden, and then of making good his own escape. He became very
penitent, was a useful member of society, and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</span> greatly attached to his
deliverer, who afterwards took him into his own service, where he
remained for some years. We cannot give a more painful illustration of
the malignity with which he was pursued, than to state that the current
version of this story in the colony was, that the convict had been
unjustly punished by Mr. Marsden as a magistrate, and took this method
of revenge.</p>

<p>He made the most, too, of his opportunities. At a time when there were
very few churches or clergymen, and the settlers were widely scattered
over large tracts, he frequently made an itinerating ministerial visit
amongst them. He was everywhere received with the greatest cordiality
and respect. On arriving at a farm, a man on horseback was immediately
dispatched to all the neighbours within ten or twelve miles to collect
them for public worship. The settlers gladly availed themselves of these
opportunities, and assembled, in numbers varying from sixty to eighty,
when Divine service was conducted in a vacant barn or under the shade of
a verandah. The next day, he proceeded twenty or twenty-five miles
further on in the wilds, and again collected a congregation. These tours
would often extend over ten days or a fortnight, and were repeated as
his more settled duties permitted. Thus his name became a household
word, pronounced with love and gratitude far beyond the limits of his
parish, or even of the colony; and probably he found some of his most
willing hearers amongst those to whom he thus carried in their solitude
the glad tidings of a salvation which when offered to them week by week
at home they had neglected or despised.</p>

<p>Yet his duties as principal chaplain were not neglected. From a general
government order, dated<span class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</span> September, 1810, it appears that amongst them
were those of an overseer, or chief pastor of the church. &#8220;The assistant
chaplains are directed to consider themselves at all times under the
immediate control and superintendence of the principal chaplain, and are
to make such occasional reports to him respecting their clerical duties
as he may think proper to require or call for.&#8221; A high tribute to his
worth under the circumstances in which he was placed by his opposition
to the governor. The chaplains frequently sought his protection against
arbitrary power, and he willingly fought their battles and his own in
defence of liberty of conscience and the right of conducting God&#8217;s
worship undisturbed. His connexion with his clerical brethren seems to
have been uniformly happy, and the same remark is true of the
missionaries of various denominations, not a few in number, who, during
a period of twenty years, were virtually under his control. He had
undoubtedly the rare power of governing others in a very high degree,
and it was done noiselessly and with a gentle hand; for the men who
govern well seldom obtrude their authority in an offensive manner, or
worry those they should control with a petty interference. He had the
same kind of influence, and probably from the same cause, over the very
horses in his carriage. He used, in driving from Sydney to Paramatta, to
throw the reins behind the dash-board, take up his book, and leave them
to themselves, his maxim being &#8220;that the horse that could not keep
itself up was not worth driving.&#8221; One of the pair was almost
unmanageable in other hands, but it was remarked that &#8220;Captain&#8221; always
conducted himself well when his master drove, and never had an
accident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 77]</span>Amongst his strictly pastoral cares, two schools for orphans had a
foremost place. A female orphan school was first proposed, and Mr.
Marsden undertook the direction of the work, and became treasurer to the
institution. From its formation in 1800 to the year 1821, two hundred
children were admitted. It may be a question whether the children of
living parents, however ignorant or even dissolute they may be, should
be totally withdrawn from parental sympathies. The presence of a child
may restrain, and its artless remonstrances are often known to touch, a
vicious father or mother whom no other influence can reach; and Dr.
Guthrie&#8217;s recent experiment in Edinburgh seems to show us that the best
method of Christianizing both child and parent is to instruct the former
well by day, and to send him home at night a little missionary to his
parents, where other teaching would be scorned. But in the case of
orphans no such questions occur, and we must look upon an orphan school
with unmixed satisfaction. A male orphan school followed in due course,
in which the boys were instructed in some trade and then apprenticed. In
both schools the moral and religious training was the chief
consideration; yet Mr. Marsden&#8217;s connexion with them was attributed by
his enemies to a sordid motive, and even those in power, who should have
known him better, gave public currency to these injurious reports.</p>

<p>The fact was that when the institutions were founded the treasurer was
allowed a small per centage upon the receipts, as a clerical fee or
stipend; this he allowed to accumulate until he resigned the office,
when he presented the whole sum to the institution. The committee
absolutely refusing to accept it, he purchased cattle from the
government to the full<span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span> amount, and made a present of them to the orphan
schools. Soon after his return from England it became necessary to erect
new schools. The work was long and tedious, and owing to the want of
labour in the colony, and the idle and drunken habits of the labourers,
nearly ten years elapsed before they were completed, and the work too
was often at a stand for want of funds. These, however, Mr.
Marsden&mdash;whom no pecuniary obstacles could daunt&mdash;supplied, in a great
measure, out of his own purse, till his advances amounted to nearly
900<i>l.</i>; and his disinterested conduct in the end occasioned him very
considerable loss. To the latest period he never ceased to take the
warmest interest in the prosperity of these institutions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure,&#8221; says his daughter, &#8220;my father&#8217;s parish was not neglected.
He was well known to all his parishioners, as he was in the habit of
constantly calling upon them. He was very attentive to the sick, whether
at their own homes or at the government hospital. He also took great
interest in the education of the young. It was through his
instrumentality that many schools were established. His Sunday school,
at the time of which I speak, was in a more efficient state than any I
have since seen; but this my brother-in-law, the Rev. T. Hassell, had a
great deal to do with, as he was then acting as my father&#8217;s curate. The
factory for the reception of female convicts was built entirely by his
suggestion, and to their religious and moral improvement he devoted a
good deal of his time. It was principally owing to his endeavours to get
this and other institutions in good order that much of his discomfort
with his fellow-magistrates and government officers arose.&#8221;</p>

<p>The aborigines of Australia were, even when the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 79]</span> colony was first
settled, comparatively few in number; and in painful conformity with
universal experience, they have wasted away before the white man, and
will probably disappear in time from the face of the earth. If the New
Zealander stands highest in the scale of savage nature, the native
Australian occupies perhaps the lowest place. So low, indeed, was their
intellect rated, that when the phrenological system of Drs. Gall and
Spurzheim began to occupy attention, some forty years ago, the skulls of
several of them were sent over to England to be submitted to the
manipulations of its professors, with a view of ascertaining whether the
Creator had not thrust into existence a whole race of idiots&mdash;men who
had neither reason to guide them on the one hand, nor well-developed
instinct on the other. They are supposed to be a mixture of the Malay
and negro races, but they have nothing of the muscular strength of the
negro, nor of his mental pliancy, and both in body and mind are far
below the pure Malay. In the infancy of the colony they rambled into the
town of Port Jackson in a state of nudity, and when blankets were
presented to them they were thrown aside as an incumbrance. They seemed
to have no wants beyond those which the dart or spear&mdash;never out of
their hands&mdash;could instantly supply. Their food was the opossum, but
when this was not to be found they were by no means delicate; grubs,
snakes, putrid whales, and even vermin were eagerly devoured, though
fish and oysters were preferred. They are a nomad or wandering people,
always moving from place to place in search of food, or from the mere
love of change. During the winter, they erect a hut, resembling a
beehive, of rude wicker-work besmeared with clay; but in general a mere
hurdle, such as we use in England for<span class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span> penning sheep, placed to windward
in the ground, is all their shelter; under this they lie with a fire
kindled in the front of it. Our English stragglers have made themselves
well acquainted with their habits, frequently living amongst them for
weeks together in the bush. These all agree in admiration of the skill
with which they throw the dart, which seldom misses, even from a child&#8217;s
hand, to strike its prey. They are peaceable and inoffensive to
strangers, and kind to their &#8220;gins,&#8221; or wives, and to their children,
unless their savage natures are aroused, when they become horribly
brutal and vindictive. Few savage tribes have been found whose ideas on
religion are less distinct. They believe in a good spirit, <i>Royan</i>, and
a bad one, <i>Potoyan</i>; but like all savages&mdash;like all men, we may say,
either savage or civilized, who know not God&mdash;they dread the evil spirit
far more than they love the good one. They offer no prayer, and have no
worship or sacrifices. Civil government is unknown; authority in the
tribe depends on personal strength or cunning. A wandering life with
abundance of provisions, amongst their native woods, shores, and
mountains, is the sum of all the little happiness they know or seek.</p>

<p>Some efforts were made in the early period of the colony on their
behalf. A district near Port Jackson was assigned them, and they were
encouraged to reside in it; but it was very soon deserted. The roving
habits of the aborigines made any settled residence irksome; and their
wants were so few that they would neither engage in trade, nor submit to
labour for the sake of wages. It retained the name of the Black Town for
many years; but the black men have long since deserted it. Governor
Macquarie, after con<span class="pagenum">[Pg 81]</span>sulting with Mr. Marsden, then attempted a farm,
and, in connexion with it, a kind of reformatory school at Paramatta,
where they were to be civilized and cured of their migratory habits, and
instructed in the Christian religion. Mr. Marsden took a warm interest
in the scheme, as he did in everything that concerned the welfare of the
aborigines. Still it failed; for it was founded, as experience has
shown, upon wrong principles. Mr. Marsden, however, is not to be blamed
for this; since Governor Macquarie, having now conceived a violent
prejudice against him, omitted his name from the committee of
management, although the institution was placed in his own parish,
introducing those of two junior chaplains; and it was not till the
governor&#8217;s retirement that he took an active part in its affairs. But
the character of the institution was then fixed, and its approaching
failure was evident.</p>

<p>Two faults were interwoven with it, either of which must have proved
fatal. In the first place, the attempt to confine a nomad, wandering
tribe within the precincts of a farm, or to bring them to endure, except
it had been by force, the discipline of lads in an English workhouse,
was upon the very face of it absurd. These, we must remember, were the
early days of English philanthropy amongst wild black men. She had yet
to make her blunders and learn her first lessons. Why should a nomad
race be settled upon the workhouse plan, or even confined to an English
farm? Why should they not rather be encouraged to dwell in tents, carry
civilization with them into their own woods and mountains, and, roam,
free and fearless, over those vast regions which God had given them to
possess, until at last they themselves shall wish to adopt the settled
habits of European Chris<span class="pagenum">[Pg 82]</span>tians? A roving life in the wilderness is not
of necessity an idle or a barbarous one. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were
highly civilized, and eminently devout. &#8220;Arabians&#8221; and &#8220;dwellers in
Mesopotamia,&#8221; wanderers of the desert, heard the word with gladness, and
received the Holy Ghost upon the day of Pentecost. But we do not read
that they were required to live in cities, and abandon the
long-cherished wilderness, with all its solemn associations and grand
delights. And we have not so mean an opinion of Christianity as to
believe that it can thrive only in towns well paved and lighted, or in
farms neatly fenced and artificially cultivated. The true missionary
must track the wandering savage into the desert, and there make himself
his guide and friend; and teach him that the gospel of Jesus Christ is
indeed of God, inasmuch as it is fitted, as no human contrivance can be
fitted, for man, whatever his outward circumstances or his mode of life;
that it knows no difference between the dweller in the tent, and in
&#8220;cities, tall and fenced up to heaven.&#8221; &#8220;Barbarian, Scythian, bond or
free,&#8221; are all alike welcome to its blessings; and we can see no good
reason why there should not be Christian tribes in the wilderness, as
there were patriarchal churches in the plains of the Euphrates, long
before the law was given on Mount Sinai.</p>

<p>The other mistake was the same which has tainted other missions in their
infancy, and to which we have made some allusion. It was thought
necessary to prepare the savage mind for Christianity, by the
preliminary discipline of a civilizing process. This is inverting the
order in which God proceeds: &#8220;The entrance of thy word giveth light.&#8221;
When the voice of God speaks within, and not before, the demoniac<span class="pagenum">[Pg 83]</span> quits
&#8220;his dwelling amongst the tombs;&#8221; no longer &#8220;tears off his raiment&#8221; like
a brute beast, unconscious of shame; ceases to be &#8220;exceeding fierce,&#8221;
and is now found &#8220;sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his
right mind.&#8221; A few efforts upon this, the right evangelical principle as
we conceive, have been made from time to time amongst these degraded
aborigines; but the success has not been great. A wide field still
remains, thinly peopled and spiritually uncultivated. If these lines
should be read by our Christian friends in Australia, to them we would
venture to commend the glorious enterprise. Let there be one colony at
least in which the aborigines shall share the intruder&#8217;s prosperity. Let
the vast centre of the Australian continent one day rejoice in its
thronging tribes of Christian aborigines.</p>

<p>Mr. Marsden&#8217;s view of the native character may be gathered from the
following statement, which he published in self-defence when charged
with indifference as to their conversion. &#8220;More than twenty years ago, a
native lived with me at Paramatta, and for a while I thought I could
make something of him; but at length he got tired, and no inducement
could prevail upon him to continue in my house; he took to the bush
again, where he has continued ever since. One of my colleagues, the Rev.
R. Johnstone, took two native girls into his house, for the express
purpose of educating them; they were fed and clothed like Europeans; but
in a short time they went into the woods again. Another native, named
Daniel, was taken when a boy into the family of Mrs. C.; he was taken to
England; mixed there with the best society, and could speak English
well; but on his return from England he reverted to his former wild
pursuits.&#8221; In<span class="pagenum">[Pg 84]</span> reply to the inquiries made by Mr. Marsden, who once met
Daniel after he returned to his savage state, he said; &#8220;The natives
universally prefer a free and independent life, with all its privations,
to the least restraint.&#8221; Without multiplying instances quoted by Mr.
Marsden, the trial he made with an infant shows that his heart was not
unfriendly towards these people. &#8220;One of my boys, whom I attempted to
civilize, was taken from its mother&#8217;s breast, and brought up with my own
children for twelve years; but he retained his instinctive taste for
native food; and he wanted that attachment to me and my family that we
had just reason to look for; and always seemed deficient in those
feelings of affection which are the very bonds of social life.&#8221; This boy
ran away at Rio from Mr. Marsden, when returning from England in 1810,
but was brought back to the colony by Captain Piper; and died in the
Sydney hospital, exhibiting Christian faith and penitence. &#8220;I mentioned
to the governor,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;some of these circumstances, but not with
any view to create difficulties; so far from it, that I informed him
that I was authorized by the Church Missionary Society to assist any
plan with pecuniary aid, that was likely to benefit the natives of the
colony.&#8221; A mission was in fact set on foot by this Society; but from
various causes, it failed, and was abandoned.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Marsden&#8217;s correspondence with the London Missionary
Society&mdash;Buys the brig Active&mdash;His first Voyage to New
Zealand&mdash;Journal of Events.</p></blockquote>

<p>Richard Baxter, after describing his ministerial labours at
Kidderminster in preaching and visiting from house to house, has these
remarkable words: &#8220;But all these, my labours, even preaching and
preparing for it, were but my recreations, and, as it were, the work of
my spare hours; for my writings were my chiefest daily labour.&#8221; Mr.
Marsden had his recreations, too. Amidst the anxieties of his colonial
chaplaincy he found or made opportunities to conduct a work which of
itself would have been sufficient to exhaust the energies and to
immortalize the memory of any other man. We devote this chapter to a
short, and, of necessity, imperfect sketch of these his <i>recreations</i> in
the missionary field.</p>

<p>On his return from England in 1810, he found disastrous tidings of the
Tahitian mission awaiting his arrival. Disheartened by their utter want
of success, divided amongst themselves, distracted with fears of danger
from the natives, several of the missionaries had fled from their posts,
and taken refuge in New South Wales. The work appeared to be on the eve
of ruin, and it was owing in no small measure to the firmness and wise
conduct of Mr. Marsden that it was not, for a time at least, abandoned.
&#8220;Sooner,&#8221; he exclaims, in one of his letters to the Society at home,
&#8220;than <i>that</i> shall be the case, I<span class="pagenum">[Pg 86]</span> will give up my chaplaincy, and go
myself and live at Otaheite.&#8221; Yet it was no easy task to inspire others
with his own courage, or to impart his hopeful spirit to a desponding
band of men. He felt the difficulty, and acted towards them in the most
considerate manner. Instead of at once insisting on their return, he
received them into his family, where it is scarcely necessary to say
they were treated with that patriarchal hospitality for which the
parsonage of Paramatta was famed. When a few months had passed, and
their spirits were cheered and their health restored, the question of
their return to Tahiti was introduced and quietly discussed. Their kind
and pious host had never for an instant doubted of their ultimate
success. We have perused numerous letters addressed by him to the London
Missionary Society, and to various friends in England; but in not one of
them is the shadow of a doubt expressed as to the triumph of the gospel
in Tahiti and the Society Islands; and we may extend the remark to the
New Zealand mission, as shown by his correspondence with the Church
Missionary Society a few years later. About this period a reaction had
taken place in England amongst religious people. The fond hopes they had
unwisely entertained of seeing vast results wherever the gospel was
introduced among the heathen and upon the first proclamation of it, had
been grievously disturbed; and now the tide ran in the opposite
direction. Nothing appears to have given Mr. Marsden more uneasiness
than the general lukewarmness of the church of Christ at home, and their
despondency as to the success of missions. He speaks of his &#8220;anxious
days and sleepless nights.&#8221; But his own courage never failed; and this
high undoubting faith, it is beautiful<span class="pagenum">[Pg 87]</span> to observe, rests always on the
same foundation. It was not, much as he respected them, his confidence
either in the Societies at home, or in their missionaries abroad, but
simply in the promises of God, in the power of the gospel, and in the
unchanging love of Christ for his &#8220;inheritance&#8221; among the heathen. Thus
the missionaries were induced to return to their deserted posts; and not
only so, but to resume their work in a higher spirit of faith and
cheerfulness. It was not long before hopeful signs broke out, and within
ten years Pomare the sovereign became a Christian king, and the island
of Tahiti a Christian land.</p>

<p>The distance of these missions from Australia, and the difficulty of
communicating with them, suggested to Mr. Marsden the advantage of
employing a vessel entirely on missionary service. When his mind was
once made up he lost no time; the consent of the Societies in England
could not all at once be gained; so he resolved, at his own cost, to
purchase a missionary ship, the first probably that ever floated on the
deep, and bought the Active, a brig of a hundred tons burden, for the
service of the two great missions on which his heart was fixed. The
following letter, addressed to the Rev. George Burder, though written
two years later, is introduced here to complete our summary of the
re-establishment of the Tahitian mission:</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Paramatta, June 9, 1815.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Rev. and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I received a short letter from you by the late
arrivals, and found you had not got any very interesting accounts from
the brethren at Otaheite. The last account I had from them, they were
going on exceedingly well, and the Lord was owning and blessing their
labours. You will hear I lately visited New Zealand, and also my views
of that <span class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span>island. Finding that the Societies in London could not make up
their minds, neither as a body nor as individuals, to send out a vessel,
I at last determined to purchase one for the purpose on my own account.
The various expenses attending it have created me some little pecuniary
difficulties; but they are only known to myself, and not such as will be
attended with any serious consequence. I hope in a little time I shall
be able to surmount them; whether I shall keep the vessel in my own
hands or not, I am not certain as yet. I cannot do it without some
assistance at the first; if I could, I certainly would not trouble any
of my friends. The vessel has been twice at New Zealand, and is gone a
third time. When she returns I intend her to visit the brethren at
Otaheite. It is my intention that she should sail in August next to
Otaheite. The brethren there have been labouring hard to build a vessel
for themselves, which is almost completed. I have agreed to take a share
with them in her. During the time the brethren have been building their
vessel, the work of the Lord appears to have prospered very much, far
beyond all expectation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>He adds, &#8220;I estimate the expenses of the vessel at 1500<i>l.</i> per annum,
and I think, if I am not mistaken in my views, that her returns will not
be less than 1000<i>l.</i> per annum, and perhaps more. I may venture to say
I should not call on the two Societies for more than the sum I have
stated, namely, 500<i>l.</i> per annum from this time. I will not demand
anything if the returns cover the expenses for the use of the vessel.&#8221;
These returns were to be obtained by &#8220;freighting the Active with the
produce of the industry of the natives, and trading with them in
return.&#8221; This would &#8220;stimulate their exertions, correct their vagrant
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span>minds, and enrich them with the comforts and conveniences of civil
life.&#8221; The letter closes with suggesting yet another mission; for the
large heart of the writer saw in the approaching triumph of the gospel
in his favourite missions only a call to fresh exertions. Even as Paul,
when he had &#8220;fully preached from Jerusalem round about unto Illyricum,&#8221;
sighed after fresh labours, and still remoter conquests for his Lord. &#8220;I
wish to mention to you that it would be a great object if the Society
would turn their thoughts a little to the Friendly Islands. New Zealand
being on one side, and the Society Islands on the other, with labourers
now upon them, the Friendly Islands ought not to be left destitute.
These islands are very populous, and as the London Missionary Society
first began the work there, I think they should renew their attempt. I
cannot recommend any establishment upon any of the islands in the South
Seas, unless commerce is more or less attended to, in order to call
forth the industry of the natives. Provided the Society as a body will
not consent to have anything to do with commerce, I see no reason why a
few pious friends might not, who wish to aid the missionary cause. You
cannot form a nation without commerce and the civil arts. A person of
information who is well acquainted with the Friendly Islands informed me
that the labour of a hundred thousand men might be brought into action
upon these islands in producing sugar, cordage, cotton, etc.... A
hundred thousand men will never form themselves into any regular
society, and enjoy the productions of their country without commerce.
Should the Society have any doubts upon the point, let them authorize an
inquiry into the state of these islands, when there is<span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span> an opportunity
to examine them, and a report of their inhabitants and their productions
laid out before them.&#8221; Mr. Marsden then describes the openings at New
Zealand, and concludes a long letter thus: &#8220;I have stated my sentiments
with great haste. You will excuse the hasty scrawl. I can assure you my
sincere wish and prayer to the great Head of the church is that all may
prosper that love him. I am, dear sir, yours affectionately, <span class="smcap">S.
Marsden</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>A postscript adds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Since writing this letter, I have determined to keep the Active
in my own hands.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us now turn to the New Zealand mission, which occupied, from this
time, so large a portion of Mr. Marsden&#8217;s public life.</p>

<p>We have mentioned the designation of two laymen, Messrs. Hall and King,
for this mission by the Church Missionary Society in 1808. They sailed
from England, with Mr. Marsden, in 1810, and were soon after followed by
Mr. Kendall, and the three assembled at New South Wales, intending to
sail thence without delay for the scene of their future work. But here
fresh difficulties arose. Mr. Marsden&#8217;s intention was to accompany them,
and in person to meet the first dangers, and lay, as it were, the first
stone. But this the new governor absolutely forbade. To him, and in fact
to most men in his circumstances, the whole scheme seemed utterly
preposterous. The idea of converting the savages of New Zealand was the
chimera of a pious enthusiast&mdash;a good and useful man in his way, but one
who was not to be allowed thus idly to squander the lives of others, to
say nothing of his own. Nor in truth were the governor&#8217;s objections
altogether without foundation. The last news from<span class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</span> New Zealand was that
an English ship, the Boyd, had been seized and burned by the cannibals
in the Bay of Islands, and every soul on board, seventy in all, killed
and eaten. The report was true, save only that, out of the whole of the
ship&#8217;s company, two women and a boy had been spared to live in slavery
with the savages. A New Zealand chief had sailed on board, as it
afterwards appeared, and had been treated with brutal indignities
similar to those which Duaterra suffered from the captain of the Santa
Anna. He smothered his resentment, and, waiting the return of the Boyd
to the Bay of Islands, summoned his tribe, who, on various pretences,
crowded the deck of the ship, and at a given signal rushed upon the
crew, dispatched them with their clubs and hatchets, and then gorged
themselves and their followers on the horrible repast. All then that Mr.
Marsden could obtain at present was permission to charter a vessel, if a
captain could be found sufficiently courageous to risk his life and ship
in such an enterprise, and to send out the three missionaries as
pioneers; with a reluctant promise from the governor that if on the
ship&#8217;s return, all had turned out well, he should not be hindered from
following. For some time no such adventurous captain could be found. At
length, for the sum of 600<i>l.</i> for a single voyage, an offer was made,
but Mr. Marsden looked upon the sum as far too much; and this, with
other considerations, induced him to purchase his own missionary brig,
the Active, in which Messrs. Hall and Kendall finally set sail for the
Bay of Islands. They carried a message to Duaterra, entreating him to
receive them kindly, and inviting him, too, to return with them to
Paramatta, bringing along with him two or three friendly chiefs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 92]</span>Duaterra, after his visit to Mr. Marsden, on his way from England, had
again suffered great hardships from the perfidy of the master of the
Frederick, with whom he had embarked from New South Wales under an
express engagement to be set on shore at the Bay of Islands, where his
tribe dwelt. He was carried to Norfolk Island, and there left; and, to
aggravate his wrongs and sorrows, the vessel passed within two miles of
his own shores and in sight of his long lost home. He was defrauded too
of his share of the oil he had procured with his companions, worth
100<i>l</i>. A whaler found him on Norfolk Island, almost naked and in the
last stage of want, and brought him once more to Australia and to his
friend and patron Mr. Marsden. A short stay sufficed; he sailed again
from Sydney, and soon found himself, to his great joy, amongst his
friends in New Zealand. On the arrival of the Active with its
missionaries&mdash;the first messengers of Christ who landed on its
shores&mdash;he was there to greet them, and to repay, a thousandfold, the
kindness of his friend the minister of Paramatta, in the welcome he
secured for these defenceless strangers. They carried with them too a
present which, trifling as it may seem, was not without its share of
influence in the great work; the story is suggestive, and may serve a
higher purpose than merely to amuse the reader.</p>

<p>Duaterra had been provided by Mr. Marsden with a supply of wheat for
sowing on his return to New Zealand. No such thing as a field of grain
of any kind had yet waved its golden ears on that fertile soil. To this
accomplished savage the honour belongs of first introducing agriculture
into an island destined, within forty years, to rival the best farms of
England<span class="pagenum">[Pg 93]</span> both in the value of its crops and the variety of its produce.
The neighbouring chiefs and their tribes viewed with wonder first the
green ears and then the growing corn. The wild potato, the fern, and a
few other roots were the only produce of the earth they were yet
acquainted with, and when Duaterra assured them that his field of wheat
was to yield the flour out of which the bread and biscuits they had
tasted on English ships were made, they tore up several plants,
expecting to find something resembling their own potato at the root.
That the ears themselves should furnish the materials for a loaf was not
to be believed. Duaterra meant to impose upon them, or else he had been
duped himself, but they were not to be cajoled with the tales of a
traveller. The field was reaped and the corn threshed out, when Duaterra
was mortified with the discovery that he was not provided with a mill.
He made several attempts to grind his corn with the help of a
coffee-mill borrowed from a trading-ship, but without success; and now,
like the inventor of steam navigation, and other benefactors of their
species nearer home, he was laughed at for his simplicity. It is strange
that the ancient Roman <i>quern</i>, a hollow stone in which the grain was
pounded, the rudest form in fact of the pestle and mortar, should not
have occurred to him; but the total want of invention is an invariable
characteristic of savage nature. At length the Active brought the
important present of a hand-mill for grinding corn. Duaterra&#8217;s friends
assembled to watch the experiment, still incredulous of the promised
result; but when the meal began to stream out beneath the machine their
astonishment was unbounded; and when a cake was produced, hastily baked
in a frying-pan, they shouted<span class="pagenum">[Pg 94]</span> and danced for joy, Duaterra was now to
be trusted when he told them that the missionaries were good men. And
thus the first favourable impression was made upon the savage Maories,
whose race was in the next generation to become a civilized and
Christian people.</p>

<p>Messrs Hall and Kendall, having introduced themselves and their mission
in New Zealand, now, in obedience to their instructions, returned to
Sydney accompanied by Duaterra and six other chiefs, amongst whom was
Duaterra&#8217;s uncle the famous Shunghie, or Hongi, the most powerful of New
Zealand chieftains; such was the confidence which Mr. Marsden&#8217;s name,
together with the good conduct of the missionaries, had now inspired.
The Active reached New South Wales on the 22nd of August, 1814. Nothing
could exceed the joy which Mr. Marsden experienced on the successful
termination of the voyage, and being filled with an earnest desire to
promote the dissemination of the gospel amongst the New Zealanders, and
having obtained the governor&#8217;s permission, he determined to accompany
the missionaries on their return to the Bay of Islands. To his friend,
Avison Terry, Esq., he wrote just before he sailed, Oct. 7, 1814&mdash;&#8220;It is
my intention to visit New Zealand and see what can be done to promote
the eternal welfare of the inhabitants of that island. I have now
several of the chiefs living with me at Paramatta. They are as noble a
race of men as are to be met with in any part of the world. I trust I
shall be able, in some measure, to put a stop to those dreadful murders
which have been committed upon the island for some years past, both by
the Europeans and the natives. They are a much injured people,
notwithstanding all that has been advanced<span class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</span> against them. The time is
now come, in my opinion, for them to be favoured with the everlasting
gospel; and I trust to hear the joyful sound in those dark and dreary
regions of sin and spiritual bondage. I have long had the most ardent
wish to visit these poor heathen, but have never till the present time
obtained permission. I have submitted my views to the Church Missionary
Society, and solicited their aid. The expense of establishing a mission
here will at first be very considerable.&#8221; ... [Here he mentions his
purchase of the Active, etc.] &#8220;Should the Society approve of my views,
no doubt they will give their support, but if they cannot enter into
them in the manner I do, I cannot expect that assistance from them which
may be required. My own means will enable me to set the mission on foot
in the first instance, and I have little doubt but it will succeed.&#8221;
Zeal such as this, tempered with discretion and guided by the &#8220;wisdom
which cometh from above,&#8221; in answer to many believing prayers, could
scarcely fail of its sure reward.</p>

<p>On the 19th of November, 1814, he embarked on his great mission, with a
motley crew, such as (except perhaps on some other missionary ship) has
seldom sailed in one small vessel&mdash;savages and Christian teachers and
enterprising mechanics, their wives and children, besides cattle and
horses. Of this strangely assorted company he gives the following
description: &#8220;The number of persons on board the Active, including women
and children, was thirty-five; the master, his wife and son, Messrs.
Kendall, Hall, and King, with their wives and children, eight New
Zealanders, (including Duaterra and his uncle the great warrior Shunghie
or Hongi) two Otaheitans, and four Europeans belonging to the vessel,
besides Mr. John<span class="pagenum">[Pg 96]</span> Lydiard Nicholas and myself; there were also two
sawyers, one smith, and a runaway convict whom we afterwards found on
board, a horse and two mares, one bull and two cows, with a few sheep
and poultry. The bull and cows have been presented by Governor Macquarie
from his Majesty&#8217;s herd.&#8221; On the 15th December, they were in sight of
land; the next day, the chiefs were sent on shore, and a friendly
communication was at once opened with the natives. But even before they
had landed &#8220;a canoe came alongside the Active, with plenty of fish, and
shortly afterwards a chief followed from the shore, who immediately came
on board.&#8221; Mr. Marsden&#8217;s fame, as the friend of the New Zealanders, had
arrived before him. &#8220;I told them my name, with which they were all well
acquainted.... We were now quite free from all fear, as the natives
seemed desirous to show us attention by every possible means in their
power.&#8221; The Active dropped her anchor a few days after at Wangaroa, near
the Bay of Islands, the scene of the massacre of the Boyd&#8217;s crew, and
there amongst the very cannibals by whose hands their countrymen had
fallen so recently the first Christian mission to New Zealand was
opened. A fierce and unholy revenge had been taken, in the murder of
Tippahee, a native chieftain, and all his family, by an English crew who
had visited Wangaroa after the Boyd&#8217;s destruction, and Tippahee, as Mr.
Marsden always maintained, suffered unjustly, having had no share in the
dreadful massacre. But thus it was; and amongst a people so exasperated
did these servants of the most high God venture forth as the heralds of
the gospel. Seldom since the words of the prophet were first uttered
have they had, in reference to missionaries, a more significant, or a
more correct<span class="pagenum">[Pg 97]</span> appropriation than they now received. &#8220;How beautiful upon
the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that
publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth
salvation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Marsden&#8217;s journal of this his first visit to New Zealand is a
document of singular interest, and when published at the time in
England, it made a deep impression. It is written in plain and forcible
language, and is characterized by that vein of good sense and practical
wisdom which so distinguished him. There is no display of his own
sufferings, trials and privations, no affectation of laboured and
studied expression, no highly coloured and partial representation of the
savage condition of the natives. All his aim is to lay the truth before
the Society and the friends of missions, and in doing so he has written
with a degree of accuracy and honest feeling, which while they inform
the understanding at once reach the heart. From this unpretending
record, a few selections will be laid before the reader. And here, too,
we would, once for all, acknowledge our obligations to his &#8220;companion in
travel,&#8221; J. L. Nicholas, Esq., to whose manuscript journal of the visit
to New Zealand, as well indeed as for other communications of great
interest on the subject of Mr. Marsden&#8217;s life and labours, we shall be
much indebted through the future pages of our work.</p>

<p>Duaterra and Shunghie had often told of the bloody war, arising out of
the affair of the Boyd, that was raging, while they were at Paramatta,
between the people of Wangaroa (the tribe of Tippahee) and the
inhabitants of the Bay of Islands, who were their own friends and
followers; the Wangaroans accusing the people of the Bay of Islands of
having conspired with the English in the murder of Tippahee. When the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 98]</span>
Active arrived, several desperate battles had been fought, and the war
was likely to continue.</p>

<p>Mr. Marsden was determined to establish peace amongst these contending
tribes. He was known already as the friend of Duaterra and Shunghie; he
now felt that he must convince the other party of his good intentions.
He did not come amongst them as an ally of either, but as the friend of
both; he resolved therefore to pass some time with the Wangaroans; and
with a degree of intrepidity truly astonishing even in him, not only
ventured on shore, but actually passed the night, accompanied by his
friend Mr. Nicholas alone, with the very savages who had killed and
eaten his countrymen. After a supper of fish and potatoes in the camp of
Shunghie, they walked over to the hostile camp distant about a mile.
They received the two white strangers very cordially. &#8220;We sat down
amongst them, and the chiefs surrounded us.&#8221; Mr. Marsden then introduced
the subject of his embassy, explained the object of the missionaries in
coming to live amongst them, and showed how much peace would conduce in
every way to the welfare of all parties. A chief, to whom the Europeans
gave the name of George, acted as interpreter; he had sailed on board an
English ship, and spoke English well. Mr. Marsden tells us how the first
night was passed: &#8220;As the evening advanced the people began to retire to
rest in different groups. About eleven o&#8217;clock Mr. Nicholas and I
wrapped ourselves in our great coats, and prepared for rest. George
directed me to lie by his side. His wife and child lay on the right
hand, and Mr. Nicholas close by. The night was clear; the stars shone
bright, and the sea in our front was smooth; around us were innumerable
spears stuck<span class="pagenum">[Pg 99]</span> upright in the ground, and groups of natives lying in all
directions, like a flock of sheep upon the grass, as there were neither
tents nor huts to cover them. I viewed our present situation with
sensations and feelings that I cannot express, surrounded by cannibals
who had massacred and devoured our countrymen. I wondered much at the
mysteries of providence, and how these things could be. Never did I
behold the blessed advantage of civilization in a more grateful light
than now. I did not sleep much during the night. My mind was too
seriously occupied by the present scene, and the new and strange ideas
it naturally excited. About three in the morning I rose and walked about
the camp, surveying the different groups of natives. When the morning
light returned we beheld men, women, and children, asleep in all
directions like the beasts of the field. I had ordered the boat to come
on shore for us at daylight; and soon after Duaterra arrived in the
camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the morning he gave an invitation to the chiefs to breakfast on board
the Active, which they readily accepted. &#8220;At first I entertained doubts
whether the chiefs would trust themselves with us or not, on account of
the Boyd, lest we should detain them when we had them in our power; but
they showed no signs of fear, and went on board with apparent
confidence. The axes, billhooks, prints, etc., I intended to give them
were all got ready after breakfast; the chiefs were seated in the cabin
in great form to receive the presents, I sat on the one side, and they
on the other side of the table; Duaterra stood and handed me each
article separately that I was to give them. Messrs. Kendall, Hall, and
King, with the master of the Active and his son, were all one after the
other intro<span class="pagenum">[Pg 100]</span>duced to the chiefs. The chiefs were at the same time
informed what duty each of the three persons were appointed to do. Mr.
Kendall to instruct their children, Mr. Hall to build houses, boats,
etc., Mr. King to make fishing lines, and Mr. Hanson to command the
Active, which would be employed in bringing axes and such things as were
wanted from Sydney, to enable them to cultivate their lands and improve
their country. When these ceremonies were over, I expressed my hope that
they would have no more wars, but from that time would be reconciled to
each other. Duaterra, Shunghie, and Koro Koro shook hands with the
chiefs of Wangaroa, and saluted each other as a token of reconciliation
by joining their noses together. I was much gratified to see these men
at amity once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chieftains now took their leave, much pleased with the attention of
Mr. Marsden, and still more so with his presents; and they promised for
the future to protect the missionaries and never to injure the European
traders. Some of the presents excited no little wonder; no New
Zealander, except the few who like Duaterra had been on foreign travel,
had ever seen either cows or horses, for the largest quadruped yet
naturalized in the island was the pig, and even that had been introduced
but recently. Duaterra had often told his wondering countrymen of the
horse and its rider, and in return was always laughed at; but when the
horses were now landed and Mr. Marsden actually mounted one of them,
they stood in crowds and gazed in mute astonishment. These traits of
infant civilization are not without their use to those who may hereafter
be cast among barbarous tribes, or may attempt their improvement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 101]</span>The first Sunday on which the one true God was worshipped in New Zealand
since the creation, will be for ever memorable in her annals. It was
also Christmas-day, the 25th of December, 1815, &#8220;a day much to be
remembered.&#8221; Mr. Marsden thus describes it: &#8220;Duaterra passed the
remaining part of the previous day in preparing for the sabbath. He
inclosed about half an acre of land with a fence, erected a pulpit and
reading desk in the centre, and covered the whole either with black
native cloth or some duck which he had brought with him from Port
Jackson. He also procured some bottoms of old canoes, and fixed them up
as seats on each side of the pulpit, for the Europeans to sit upon;
intending to have divine service performed there the next day. These
preparations he made of his own accord; and in the evening informed me
that everything was ready for divine service. I was much pleased with
this singular mark of his attention. The reading-desk was about three
feet from the ground, and the pulpit about six feet. The black cloth
covered the top of the pulpit, and hung over the sides; the bottom of
the pulpit, as well as the reading-desk, was part of a canoe. The whole
was becoming, and had a solemn appearance. He had also erected a
flagstaff on the highest hill in the village, which had a very
commanding view.</p>

<p>&#8220;On Sunday morning, when I was upon deck, I saw the English flag flying,
which was a pleasing sight in New Zealand. I considered it as the signal
and the dawn of civilization, liberty and religion, in that dark and
benighted land. I never viewed the British colours with more
gratification; and flattered myself they would never be removed, till
the natives of that island enjoyed all the happiness of British
subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 102]</span>&#8220;About ten o&#8217;clock we prepared to go ashore, to publish for the first
time the glad tidings of the gospel. I was under no apprehension for the
safety of the vessel; and, therefore, ordered all on board to go on
shore to attend divine service, except the master and one man. When we
landed, we found Koro Koro, Duaterra, and Shunghie, dressed in
regimentals, which Governor Macquarie had given them, with their men
drawn up, ready to be marched into the inclosure to attend divine
service. They had their swords by their sides, and switches in their
hands. We entered the inclosure, and were placed on the seats on each
side of the pulpit. Koro Koro marched his men, and placed them on my
right hand, in the rear of the Europeans: and Duaterra placed his men on
the left. The inhabitants of the town, with the women and children, and
a number of other chiefs, formed a circle round the whole. A very solemn
silence prevailed&mdash;the sight was truly impressive. I rose up and began
the service with singing the Old Hundredth Psalm; and felt my very soul
melt within me when I viewed my congregation, and considered the state
they were in. After reading the service, during which the natives stood
up and sat down at the signals given by Koro Koro&#8217;s switch, which was
regulated by the movements of the Europeans, it being Christmas day, I
preached from the second chapter of St. Luke&#8217;s gospel and tenth verse,
&#8216;Behold, I bring you glad tidings of great joy,&#8221; etc. The natives told
Duaterra that they could not understand what I meant. He replied, that
they were not to mind that now, for they would understand by-and-by; and
that he would explain my meaning as far as he could. When I had done
preaching, he informed them what I had been talking about. Duaterra was<span class="pagenum">[Pg 103]</span>
very much pleased that he had been able to make all the necessary
preparations for the performance of divine worship in so short a time,
and we felt much obliged to him for his attention. He was extremely
anxious to convince us that he would do everything in his power, and
that the good of his country was his principal consideration.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this manner, the gospel has been introduced into New Zealand; and I
fervently pray that the glory of it may never depart from its
inhabitants till time shall be no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>The confidence of the natives in Mr. Marsden was now unbounded, and
scarcely less was the confidence he reposed in them; and he resolved
upon a short coasting voyage, with the view of exploring their different
harbours, and making arrangements for the future extension of the
mission. Many of the chiefs and warriors, led by Duaterra, wished to
sail with him, and without the slightest misgiving, twenty-eight
savages, fully armed after the fashion of their country, were invited on
board the Active, manned as she was by only seven Europeans. &#8220;I do not
believe,&#8221; Mr. Nicholas observes, &#8220;that a similar instance can be shown
of such unlimited confidence placed in a race of savages known to be
cannibals. We are wholly in their power, and what is there to hinder
them from abusing it? Next to the overruling providence of God, there is
nothing but the character of the ship, which seems to have something
almost sacred in their eyes, and the influence of Mr. Marsden&#8217;s name,
which acts as a talisman amongst them. They feel convinced that he is
sacrificing his own ease and comfort to promote their welfare.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their leave of absence having nearly expired, Mr.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 104]</span> Marsden and his
companions were now obliged to prepare for their voyage homeward. They
had laid the foundations of a great work&mdash;how great, none of them could
tell. But they were full of faith in God, while, as patriots, they
exulted in the prospect of extending the renown of dear old England. Mr.
Marsden, in his conversations with the natives, explained to them the
nature of our government, and the form of trial by jury; he discoursed
with them upon the evils of polygamy, and showed his marked abhorrence
of their darling vices&mdash;theft and lying. A chisel being lost from the
Active a boat was sent on shore, manned by Duaterra and other
chieftains, to demand restitution; the culprit was not found, nor the
implement restored; but a whole village was aroused from its slumbers at
midnight, and the inhabitants literally trembled with fear of the
consequences when they saw the angry chieftains, though no harm was
permitted to ensue. An example of high integrity was always set. Mr.
Marsden might, for instance, have obtained land, or timber, or, in
short, whatever he required in exchange for ammunition and muskets; but
he sternly interdicted the sale or barter of these articles upon any
terms whatever, and to this resolution he always adhered. Again and
again does he express his determination, as well in this its earliest
stage as in later periods of the mission, rather to abandon the whole
work, which was far dearer to him than life itself, than to suffer it to
be tainted by what he considered so nefarious a barter. &#8220;I further told
them,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that the smith should make axes or hoes, or any other
tools they wanted; but that he was on no account to repair any pistols
or muskets, or make any warlike instruments, no not even for the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 105]</span>
greatest chiefs upon the island.&#8221; And he &#8220;took an opportunity, upon all
occasions, to impress upon their minds the horrors their cannibalism
excited; how much their nation was disgraced by it, and dreaded on this
account.&#8221;</p>

<p>One thing still remained to be done. The missionaries possessed no land,
and were liable, after his departure, to be removed or driven out at the
mere caprice of the tribes amongst whom they settled. He therefore
determined, if possible, to purchase for them a small estate. It
consisted of about two hundred acres; and the first plot of ground to
which England can lay claim in New Zealand was formally made over in a
deed, of which Mr. Nicholas has fortunately preserved a transcript. It
was executed in the presence of a number of chiefs, who were assembled
to take leave of the Active on the day before she sailed, and ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Know all men to whom these presents shall come, that I, Anodee O Gunna,
king of Rangheehoo, in the island of New Zealand, have, in consideration
of twelve axes to me in hand now paid and delivered by the Reverend
Samuel Marsden of Paramatta, in the territory of New South Wales, given,
granted, bargained, and sold; and by this present instrument do give,
grant, bargain, and sell unto the committee of the Church Missionary
Society for Africa and the East, instituted in London, in the kingdom of
Great Britain, and to their heirs and successors, all that piece and
parcel of land situate in the district of Hoshee, in the island of New
Zealand, bounded on the south side by the bay of Lippouna and the town
of Rangheehoo, on the north side by a creek of fresh water, and on the
west by a public road into the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 106]</span> interior, together with all the rights,
members, privileges, and appurtenances thereto belonging; to have and to
hold to the aforesaid committee of the Church Missionary Society for
Africa and the East, instituted in London, in the kingdom of Great
Britain, their heirs, successors, and assigns, for ever, clear and freed
from all taxes, charges, impositions, and contributions whatsoever, as
and for their own absolute and proper estate for ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;In testimony whereof I have to these presents, thus done and
given, set my hand at Hoshee, in the island of New Zealand, this
twenty-fourth day of February, in the year of Christ, one thousand
eight hundred and fifteen.</p>

<p class="quotsig">(Signatures to the grant.) &#8220;<span class="smcap">Thomas Kendall</span>.<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">J. L. Nicholas</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>To this was affixed a complete drawing of the &#8220;amoco,&#8221; or tattooing of
Gunna&#8217;s face, done by Shunghie, on one side of which he set his mark.</p>

<p>We need scarcely remind the reader how closely this transaction
resembles the famous contract of William Penn with the native Indians,
by which he became possessed of Pennsylvania. Much and justly as Penn
has been admired, Mr. Marsden&#8217;s conduct is even more worthy of respect.
Penn sought to found a colony, to place himself at its head, and to
associate his own name with it through generations to come. The chaplain
of Paramatta had not even these motives of honest and laudable ambition;
he sought nothing for himself, nothing for his country, nothing even for
the church of which he was a member, and which he warmly loved. His one
aim was to evangelize New<span class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span> Zealand; to bring a nation of cannibals from
darkness into the marvellous light of the gospel, and from the power of
Satan unto God. His own name appears on the instrument only as the agent
or representative of a missionary society in whom the property was
vested; and yet at the time the purchase was made he was uncertain
whether the bare expenses of his voyage, or even the cost and charges of
his vessel, would ever be repaid to him. He sought neither wealth, nor
honour, nor preferment, but acted with a simple aim to the glory of God.
The memorial of such a name can never perish amongst men; and should it
be forgotten, still his record is on high.</p>

<p>Mr. Marsden returned from his first voyage to New Zealand accompanied by
no less than ten chiefs, and landed at Sydney on the 23rd of March,
1815. He and Mr. Nicholas immediately presented themselves to the
governor, who &#8220;congratulated them on their safe return,&#8221; from what, in
common with all the colony, he regarded as a most perilous and rash
adventure.</p>

Philo-free&mdash;Letter to Rev. George Burder&mdash;To Dr. Mason
Good&mdash;Sympathy of his Friends in England&mdash;Congratulations of the

<p>It was not to be expected that a career of unbroken success and easy
triumph should crown the infant mission in New Zealand. Reverses and
delays were to be looked for; they were in the nature of the work
itself; and for such trials Mr. Marsden was prepared. But he had
scarcely arrived at Paramatta before he was involved in sharper
conflicts. No doubt they were a part of God&#8217;s discipline of love: for if
Paul required &#8220;a thorn in the flesh&#8221; lest he &#8220;should be exalted above
measure,&#8221; meaner disciples may surely expect to meet with stern rebuffs,
in their career of usefulness and honour; and they will even learn to
accept them with a thankful and a joyous heart.</p>

<p>The first discouragement was the death of Duaterra. Mr. Marsden had left
him sick; and four days after his departure he expired, surrounded by
his heathen countrymen, from whose superstitions, even to the last, he
was by no means free. &#8220;He appeared at this awful moment,&#8221; Mr. Marsden
writes, describing his last interview, &#8220;not to know what to do. He
wished me to pray with him, which I did; but the superstitions of his
country had evidently a strong hold upon his mind; the priest was always
with him, night and day. Duaterra seemed at a loss where to repose his
afflicted mind; his views of the gospel were not suffi<span class="pagenum">[Pg 109]</span>ciently clear to
remove his superstitions; and at the same time he was happy to hear what
I had to say to him. What horrors do these poor people suffer when they
come to die!&#8221; His favourite wife, Dahoo, was inconsolable; and while
Shunghie and his near relatives cut themselves with knives till the
blood gushed out, she sought and found an opportunity to put a period to
her own life by hanging herself, at a short distance from the body of
her husband. None of the natives, not even her relatives, appeared
shocked or surprised. &#8220;Her mother,&#8221; Mr. Kendall wrote, &#8220;wept while she
was composing the limbs of her daughter; but she applauded her
resolution, and the sacrifice which she had made for the man she so
tenderly loved. Her father observed her corpse without any apparent
concern. I could not discover a tear at the time it was brought before
him. Two of her brothers smiled on the occasion, and said, &#8216;it was a
good thing at New Zealand.&#8217; It is common for women to act thus when
their husbands die; they think that they then go to them.&#8221; Mr. Marsden,
for a time, was almost overwhelmed. &#8220;I could not but view Duaterra, as
he lay dying, with wonder and astonishment; and could scarcely bring
myself to believe that the Divine Goodness would remove from the earth a
man whose life appeared of such infinite importance to his country,
which was just emerging from barbarism and superstition. No doubt but he
had done his work and finished his appointed course, though I fondly
imagined he had only just begun his race. He was in the prime and vigour
of manhood: I judge his age to be about twenty-eight years. In
reflecting on this awful and mysterious event, I am led to exclaim, with
the apostle of the Gentiles, &#8216;Oh the depth of the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</span> riches both of the
wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his
ways past finding out!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>He was indeed a noble specimen of human nature in its savage state. His
character was cast in the mould of heroes: at the very period of his
death, after ten years of as much privation, danger, and hardship as
nature could well bear, his courage was unsubdued, and his patriotism
and enterprise unabated. He told Mr. Marsden with an air of triumph, &#8220;I
have now introduced the cultivation of wheat into New Zealand; New
Zealand will become a great country; in two years more I shall be able
to export wheat to Port Jackson, in exchange for hoes, axes, spades, tea
and sugar.&#8221; He had made arrangements for farming on a large scale, and
had formed his plan for building a new town, with regular streets, after
the European mode, on a beautiful situation which commanded a view of
the harbour and the adjacent country. &#8220;I accompanied him to the spot,&#8221;
says Mr. M.; &#8220;we examined the ground fixed on for the town, and the
situation where the church was to stand.&#8221; Had he lived he would have
been the Ulysses of his Ithaca&mdash;perhaps its Alfred; and nothing in his
whole life gives us a juster idea of Mr. Marsden&#8217;s sagacity and keen
perception than the fact of his singling out Duaterra, a sick and
apparently dying common sailor on shipboard, and training him to be a
powerful instrument, in God&#8217;s hands, for the civilization of New
Zealand.</p>

<p>Other trials followed the death of Duaterra. Fresh wars broke out. One
hostile tribe encamped in sight of the mission premises, and, no longer
restrained by Mr. Marsden&#8217;s presence, threatened, not indeed to expel
the missionaries, but to kill and eat<span class="pagenum">[Pg 111]</span> them. For months together the
affrighted band kept watch night and day; their children were laid to
sleep in their cots dressed, to be ready for instant flight, and the
boat was always kept afloat, with its oars and sail in readiness. The
storm blew over, and they remained stedfast at their posts. Soon
afterwards, the Wesleyan Methodists established their important and
successful mission in the island, and the missionaries gained strength
from each other in society and mutual counsel. The first Wesleyan
missionary, the Rev. Samuel Leigh, was well known at Paramatta, and Mr.
Marsden viewed his labours with thankfulness and hope; but the reports
which reached him from time to time of the difficulties to which the
missions were exposed still added much to his anxieties.</p>

<p>And now a series of persecutions began, which, while they never cowed
his brave spirit, harassed and disturbed him more than those who were
acquainted only with the outward features of his strong, dauntless
character would have readily believed. It is greatly to his honour that
all the sufferings to which he was exposed&mdash;newspaper libels, official
misrepresentations, and personal abuse&mdash;arose immediately out of his
endeavours to raise the morals of the colony, and to protect the unhappy
women who came out as convicts, and were at that time exposed by most
iniquitous neglect to still further degradation.</p>

<p>Just before his departure for New Zealand, he had addressed an official
letter to the governor, calling his attention to the present state of
Paramatta and its neighbourhood, as far as it related to its public
morals and police, and especially with regard to the female convicts, of
whom upwards of one hundred and fifty, besides seventy children, were
employed in a government<span class="pagenum">[Pg 112]</span> factory there, and whose condition, as far as
we can venture to describe it, may be gathered from the following
passage. The scene is painful; it is the dark side of our colonial
history; but those who will not listen to these recitals can know but
little of the obligations which society is under to such men as Howard
and Samuel Marsden, or to heroic women, such as Mrs. Fry. In his letter
to the governor he says:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The number of women employed at the factory is one hundred and fifty;
they have seventy children. There is not any room in the factory that
can be called a bed-room for these women and children. There are only two
rooms, and these are both occupied as workshops; they are over the jail,
and are about eighty feet long and twenty wide. In these rooms there are
forty-six women daily employed, twenty spinning wool upon the common
wheel, and twenty-six carding. There are also in them the
warping-machine, etc., belonging to the factory. These rooms are crowded
all the day, and at night such women sleep in them as are confined for
recent offences, amongst the wheels, wool, and cards, and a few others,
who have no means whatever of procuring a better abode. The average
number of women who sleep in the factory is about thirty in the whole.
Many of these women have little, and some no bedding; they all sleep on
the floor. There is not a candle or bedstead belonging to the factory. I
do not deem it either safe or prudent that even thirty women should
sleep in the factory, which has been crowded all day with working
people; the air must be bad and contagious. Were the magistrate to
compel even half the number of women, with their children, to sleep in
the factory which belong to it, they could not exist. Not less than one
hundred<span class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span> and twenty women are at large in the night to sleep where they
can.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>He urges upon the governor the necessity of at least providing lodgings
in barracks for these poor creatures. &#8220;When I am called upon,&#8221; he adds,
&#8220;in the hour of sickness and want to visit them in the general hospital,
or in the wretched hovels where they lodge, my mind is often oppressed
beyond measure at the sight of their sufferings.... And if their dreary
prospect beyond the grave be viewed in a religious light it far exceeds
in horror the utmost bounds of human imagination. As their minister I
must answer ere long at the bar of Divine justice for my duty to these
objects of vice and woe, and often feel inexpressible anguish of spirit,
in the moment of their approaching dissolution, on my own and their
account, and follow them to the grave with awful forebodings lest I
should be found at last to have neglected any part of my public duty as
their minister and magistrate, and by so doing contributed to their
eternal ruin. So powerful are these reflections at times that I envy the
situation of the most menial servant who is freed from this sacred and
solemn responsibility, namely, the care of immortal souls.... I am of
opinion that no clergyman was ever placed in so painful and trying a
situation as far as relates to the moral and religious state of the
people committed to his care. I see them devoted to vice, and infamy,
and extreme wretchedness while living, and when they come to die
suffering all the horror of mind and anguish of spirit that guilt can
possibly inspire, without the means of applying any remedy in either
case.... I humbly conceive it is incompatible with the character and
wish of the British nation that her own exiles should be exposed<span class="pagenum">[Pg 114]</span> to
such privations and dangerous temptations, when she is daily feeding the
hungry, and clothing the naked, and receiving into her friendly, I may
add pious bosom, strangers whether savage or civilized of every nation
under heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>The governor courteously replied, acknowledging the receipt of his
letter; but no further steps were taken; and after waiting eighteen
months &#8220;without the most distant prospect of obtaining relief for the
female convicts from the colonial government,&#8221; he sent a copy of his own
letter, with the governor&#8217;s answer, to the British government at home.
By them it was submitted to a select committee of the House of Commons,
when, in 1819, the state of our jails came under the consideration of
parliament, and was afterwards printed in their report; Lord Bathurst,
the colonial secretary, having previously submitted it to Governor
Macquarie, requesting his opinion on the several matters it contained.
Great exasperation followed; it seemed for a time as if the whole
colony, with scarcely an exception, had risen as one man to crush the
principal chaplain, who alone had dared to expose its profligacy and to
check its abuses. The storm indeed had begun to mutter around his head
before Lord Bathurst&#8217;s communication was received. The &#8220;Sydney Gazette,&#8221;
which was under the immediate control of the governor, was allowed to
publish from week to week the most scandalous libels upon his character.
At length, a letter appeared signed Philo-free, which Mr. Marsden
suspected, and at length discovered, to have been written by the
governor&#8217;s secretary; it was aimed not merely against himself&mdash;this he
could have borne in silence&mdash;but against the conduct and the moral
character of the missionaries<span class="pagenum">[Pg 115]</span> in the South Sea Islands, whose
reputation he felt it his duty at every hazard to protect. He therefore
appealed to the laws for shelter and redress, and two successive
verdicts justified the course he took. There were at the time many, even
of his warm friends, in England, who were almost disposed to blame him
for a too sensitive and litigious spirit. But when the whole case lay
before them, the wisest and the mildest men absolved him from the
charge, and heartily approved his conduct. In the place of any comments
of our own we will lay before the reader, in his own words, some of Mr.
Marsden&#8217;s views upon the subject. They will see the principles by which
he was actuated, and they will learn with amazement how great the
difficulties with which the friends of missions have had to contend from
their own countrymen. The first letter is addressed to the Rev. George
Burder, and was read, as appears from the endorsement it bears, in the
committee of the London Missionary Society, July 10th, 1818, having been
received on the 25th of June.</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Paramatta, Dec. 9, 1817.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Rev. Sir</span>,&mdash;I wrote to you very fully by Mr. Hassall, and informed you
what state I was in at that time. Since that period I have had many hard
struggles to maintain my ground. A very shameful attack was made upon me
and the missionaries in the South Sea Islands by the governor&#8217;s
secretary, in an anonymous letter which he published in the Sydney
Gazette, and of which you are already informed. Since my last I have
brought the secretary to the criminal bar for the libel. Every means
were used to pervert judgment that the cunning and art of certain
persons could exert. After three days&#8217; contest, I obtained a verdict
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 116]</span>against the secretary. This was a matter of much joy to all who loved
the cause of religion, and also to the colony in general. The trouble,
anxiety, and expense of the trial were very great, as I had only truth
on my side. When I had got a verdict I hoped to enjoy a little quiet,
but the next Gazette in the report made of the trial, being so false and
scandalous, and casting such reflections on me and my friends, I was
compelled to appeal to Csar once more; and last Tuesday the cause was
heard before the supreme court, when I obtained a verdict again. The
supreme judge, Justice Field, is a very upright man, and acted with
great independence in the cause. A verdict was given in my favour to the
amount of 200<i>l.</i>, with costs. The expense to the secretary will not be
much less than 500<i>l.</i> None can tell what I have suffered in my mind for
the last five years, on account of the missions, from the opposition of
those in power.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must request the Society to use their interest with the British
government to check those in authority here from exposing the
missionaries, and those connected with them, to the contempt of the
whole world by such scandalous anonymous publications as that of which I
complain. I have been very anxious to leave the colony altogether, from
the continual anxiety I have suffered, and the opposition thrown in the
way of every measure I have wished to promote, for the advancement of
the kingdom of Christ among the heathen.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet he had, in truth, no ground for this despondency. St. Paul laid the
foundations of flourishing churches amidst &#8220;a great fight of
afflictions;&#8221; what wonder if one of the greatest of Protestant missions
in a later age should share in trials from which &#8220;the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 117]</span> churches in
Macedonia and Achaia&#8221; were not exempt? The letter proceeds thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I am very happy to inform you that all goes on well at the Islands,
notwithstanding the contests here. I have forwarded to you, by this
conveyance, all the letters; from them you will learn the affairs of the
missionaries: I hope all the brethren have joined them. Four thousand of
the natives can now read. I send you one of Pomare&#8217;s letters to me. Mr.
John Eyre has translated it. You will see what the views of the king
are. He is now writing a dictionary of his own language, and one of the
chiefs is employed at the press. I am very sorry they did not meet the
king&#8217;s wishes with regard to the printing press, and set it up at
Tahiti, where he lives; taking it away from him was unwise.... The main
work is done now, as far as respects the planting of the gospel. Their
native idols are burned in the fire, and many have &#8216;tasted that the Lord
is gracious&#8217; amongst the inhabitants. They sing, and read, and pray, and
teach one another, so that there can be no fear that religion will be
lost in the Islands again. The work has evidently been of God, and he
will carry it on for his own glory. They will now also have their
vessel, by which means they can visit the different islands and Port
Jackson. I should wish much to see them turning their attention to
agriculture, etc., so as to induce habits of industry among the natives,
so that the natives of the Society Islands may rank with civilized
nations.&#8221; The letter closes, after a minute detail of the affairs of
their missions, with an appeal, which, even at this distance of time,
must be read with pain, and which nothing short of mental agony would
have wrung from such a pen. &#8220;I rely with confidence<span class="pagenum">[Pg 118]</span> on the Society for
their support and protection. Unless his Majesty&#8217;s ministers will
interfere, I may expect similar attacks from the same quarter. If this
should be the case, it cannot be expected I should remain in the colony
to be ruined in my character, circumstances, and peace of mind. The last
seven years have been very dreadful. A solitary individual cannot
withstand the influence of those in power, armed with such a deadly
weapon as the public papers, and every other means of annoyance at their
command. I have written on the subject to Lord Bathurst....</p>

<p class="quotsig">&#8220;I remain, rev. Sir, yours affectionately,<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Samuel Marsden</span>.</p>
<p>&#8220;To Rev. George Burder.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In the same strain he writes to his friend Dr. Mason Good, inclosing the
letter of Philo-free, and other documents. Amongst other threats,
representations to the archbishop and the bishop of London had been
muttered in the colony, with a view no doubt of inducing them to
withdraw him from his post. &#8220;Should you learn,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that any
representations are made to the bishops, and you should deem it
necessary, I will thank you to send them the documents I have
transmitted, or any part of them, for their information. I should also
wish Mr. Wilberforce to be acquainted with them, if you will at any time
take the trouble to lay them before him.&#8221; Then turning to brighter
objects, he has the following remarkable passage:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;With regard to New Zealand, I must refer you to the Rev. Josiah Pratt,
(secretary to the Church Missionary Society). Great difficulties have
opposed the establishment upon that island; but I hope they will all be
overcome in time. We have sent two<span class="pagenum">[Pg 119]</span> young men to England, as we think
this will greatly tend to enlarge their ideas, and prepare them for
greater usefulness in their own country. I have no doubt, but that New
Zealand will soon become a civilized nation. If I were inclined to
become a prophet I should say, that all the islands in the South Seas
will afford an asylum for thousands of Europeans hereafter, and New
South Wales will give laws to, and regulate, all their governments in
the course of time. The gospel, humanly speaking, could not be planted
in the South Sea Islands, unless our government had established a colony
in New South Wales. The British government had no view of this kind when
they first formed the colony. How mysterious are all the ways of Divine
Providence! yet may the Divine footsteps be traced, if we mark
attentively what is passing in the world. God, the Governor of this
world, orders all things according to his infinite mind, and all things
well.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>He soon had reason to adopt a happier strain. The trial was severe, the
more so perhaps from the ardour of his own temperament, which, no doubt,
required the chastisement, which became in the highest sense a blessing
both to himself and others. Writing to the same friend, 3rd October,
1818, he says: &#8220;When I take a retrospect of all that has passed in this
colony since my return, I see, with wonder and gratitude, the Divine
goodness overruling the wills and affections of sinful men, and making
all things unite in promoting his glory. &#8216;Philo-free&#8217; will not be
without its benefit to the great cause. Had this libel never appeared,
the character, constitution and object of the Church, and London
Missionary Societies would not have been known in this settlement for<span class="pagenum">[Pg 120]</span>
many years to come; nor would they have gained the friends which they
will eventually do here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Letters of congratulation flowed in rapidly, both on account of his
missionary exploits in New Zealand, and of his personal triumph in New
South Wales. We can afford only to give a specimen of each; the one to
show how the successes of the gospel thrilled English Christians with
joy in the infancy of missions; and the other to exhibit the warm
affection with which the great missionary leader of the southern seas
was regarded by his friends at home.</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Hull, 7th May, 1817.</p>
<p>&#8220;From William Terry, Esq.,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 121]</span>...&#8220;The account, you gave in your letter, as
well as those sent to the Church Missionary Society,
which appeared in the Missionary Register, were very
gratifying to all who have at heart the prosperity of
Zion. I have felt peculiarly interested in the journal
of your voyage to New Zealand, and when at our (St.
John&#8217;s) church the Old Hundredth Psalm was sung, I
felt much elevated in praise to our Almighty Saviour,
that at the same period of the year, and exactly two
years before, you had been enabled to proclaim the
glad tidings of his salvation, and to commence with
the same divine song upon the heathen shores of New
Zealand. God grant that it may be the dawn of a
brighter day: that the Lord of all may be adored by
all the uncivilized world; that the Sun of righteousness
may arise and go on to shine with increasing and
transforming light and influence upon them, and upon
all others who are yet sitting in darkness and in the
shadow of death! May he bless all human attempts
to promote so glorious a cause, and particularly your
own zealous efforts; and may he, for the sake of the
same, continue, if it please him, your valuable life for
many years to come. I know, from the arduous post
which you occupy, that your time must be entirely
filled up, and that you can find very little leisure for a
correspondent like me, who can render you little or no
service.... Our esteemed friends, the Rev.
Messrs. Dykes, Scott, Clarke, and Foster, are all very
well, being in mercy continued yet to this highly
favoured town. Mr. Scott has obtained the living of
St. Margaret&#8217;s since the death of Mr. Barker, and has
engaged an excellent curate, a young man of high
birth of the name of Sibthorpe, who seems very faithful,
and will, I hope, be abundantly useful. May the
Lord bless you and your young family with all temporal
and spiritual blessings! And may he bless and direct
all your zealous endeavours to promote his cause among
the heathen, and to spread the knowledge and saving
influence of his truth to all within your influence!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Mason Good, writing on the subject of the libel,
under the date of April, 1818, says: &#8220;The triumph you
have gained is indeed complete ... persevere,
then, my dear friend, in the same good and great and
magnanimous course. The eyes of the world are
upon you, and what is more, the eye of Him who
governs the world, and will never fail to give efficacy
to his own instruments, and ultimate success to his
designs. To this time, however, notwithstanding all
the terrible threats that have been thrown out against
you, not a single syllable of complaint has arrived
from any one; do not therefore let your spirits fail.
Depend upon esteem and support at home, for your
perseverance and manly conduct have produced a very
deep and popular sensation in every quarter in which
you would wish to stand well.&#8221;</p>

<p>In addition to these gratifying testimonies from<span class="pagenum">[Pg 122]</span> home, Mr. Marsden
received a public mark of approbation from the officers of the 46th
regiment, then stationed in the colony, who with a high and chivalrous
sense of what was due to one who single handed had so long maintained
the cause of truth and righteousness, stepped forward to offer their
tribute of respect. He replied as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;To Col. Molle and the officers of the 46th regiment.</p>

<p class="quotdate">&#8220;Paramatta, 16th Oct. 1818.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;I had the honour to receive your
public letter under date 14th May, 1818, and nothing
could have given me more real gratification than the
very handsome manner in which you have communicated
your kind and friendly sentiments to me
on the issue of the trials I instituted against the
author of the libel, &#8216;Philo-free.&#8217; I beg, gentlemen,
to return you my most grateful acknowledgments for
the honour you have done me, and to assure you that
this mark of your good will to me, in bearing your
testimony to my conduct, will ever be held in the
highest estimation by me; and I trust I shall retain
to the latest moment of my life a grateful sense of
your favour to me as an individual, and at the same
time never forget the public service you rendered to
this colony from the time you landed to the day of
your departure, by your firmness and gentlemanly
conduct, as British officers, and by your good and prudent
example as members of the community.&#8221; After
these expressions of gratitude he turns aside to remark
upon the former condition of the colony, and the services
which the 46th regiment had rendered in the
cause of virtue. Proud as this regiment may justly
be of honours won in far different scenes, it will not,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 123]</span>we are assured, nor will its countrymen, regard with
other feelings than those of high satisfaction, the
following tribute to its moral worth and character.
May every regiment in the British army deserve a
similar eulogy from men who, like Job of old, and we
may add, like the chaplain of New South Wales, &#8216;know
not to give flattering titles.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you first arrived in New South Wales every
barrier against licentiousness was broken down, every
fence swept away. There were a few, and but a few,
who resolved to stand their ground, and preserve that
line of conduct which the wisest and best men consider
essential as marking the distinction between the good
and the evil.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>And again: &#8220;Had you not arrived in New South
Wales and acted the honourable part you did, the few
who were marked for future conquest would not have
been able to have stood out longer, but must have
either yielded to superior force, or have withdrawn
from the colony. Some would not have had strength
of mind sufficient to have carried on a perpetual warfare
against such an unequal force, and thus would
not have been able to meet the expense of continued
resistance. You just arrived in time to turn the
wavering balance, and to inspire the desponding with
hopes.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 124]</span>A vote of thanks, in the most cordial terms, was
also presented to him at the anniversary meeting of
the Church Missionary Society, at the Freemasons&#8217;
Tavern, in 1819. It would have been presented to
the annual meeting of the previous year, but it was a
mark of respect which had never yet been paid to any
individual by the Society. &#8220;The circumstances, however,
which have lately transpired,&#8221; so writes his
friend, Dr. Mason Good, who was a member of the
committee, &#8220;the severe and important battle you have
fought, and the triumph you have so gloriously
achieved, have induced the Society to step out of their
usual routine on this occasion, and to show, not only to
yourself, but to the world at large, the full sense they
entertain of the honourable and upright part you have
taken, and their unanimous determination to give you
all their support. I agree with you most fully that
your contest has not been a personal one, but that the
important objects of the Society have been at stake, and
that the victory you have obtained is of more importance
to the cause of virtue, honour, and true religion,
and more especially to the cause of Christian missions
in Australasia, than to yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>We shall conclude our notice of these painful conflicts
with two letters, the one from Lord Gambier,
the other from the venerable Simeon. The former
breathes the warm heart of a sailor and the mature
wisdom of an experienced Christian. And thus while
British soldiers were ready to acknowledge the integrity
of Mr. Marsden, the navy, as represented by one
of her great heroes, stood forward likewise in his behalf.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I was happy to hear of your health
and welfare by your letters to me of the 22nd January
and the 5th March, 1817, which came to my hands in
due time, though they were rather longer, I believe,
in their passage than is usual. I deeply lament with
you that your very zealous and arduous exertions to
extend the kingdom of our gracious Lord, and to diffuse
the knowledge of the glorious gospel of salvation
among the inhabitants of the dark regions around you,
should meet with the spirit of opposition from the
persons in the colony whom you naturally would look<span class="pagenum">[Pg 125]</span>
to for support and assistance. And very grievous
indeed it is that you should stand almost alone and
single in a work of charity that exceeds the praises of
human language to express its excellence and blessed
effects upon the race of mankind. Mr. Pratt will
have informed you that a special meeting of the committee
of the Church Missionary Society was held
last month for the sole purpose of deliberating
upon the communication you have made to him of
the state of the affairs of the Society, and the disgraceful
letter that appeared in the &#8216;Sydney Gazette,&#8217;
signed &#8216;Philo-free.&#8217; The result of the committee&#8217;s
consultation was, that your letters on this subject
should be referred to the consideration of the vice-presidents
of the Society, requesting them to take
such measures as they deemed most advisable to
relieve you from the distressing and painful situation
in which you were placed. I had the satisfaction of
being present at the meeting of the vice-presidents;
the bishop of Gloucester and Mr. Wilberforce were of
the number. Mr. Pratt was also present, and as he
will communicate to you the judgment that we passed
upon the occasion it is unnecessary for me to add
anything thereto; but I cannot forbear to express to
you the admiration I entertain of your conduct, your
zeal, perseverance, and unremitted exertions in the
blessed and glorious cause in which you are engaged.
May our gracious Lord be your shield; may his
powerful arm protect you against all your adversaries,
and enable you to overcome them all with the
weapons of a Christian warfare, meekness, patience,
faith, and charity; and may he lay them all at
your feet.! May his grace be sufficient for you, and
give you strength to go on as you have done in his<span class="pagenum">[Pg 126]</span>
service, to the glory of his name and to the salvation
of the heathen nations around! You have achieved
great things in New Zealand. May the seed you have
sown there be like the grain of mustard, and grow to
a large tree; and may you finally receive the bright
reward of your labours, and have that blessing pronounced
upon you, &#8216;Well done, good and faithful
servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.&#8217; There
is a fine field for missionary labours in New Zealand,
and I anticipate the happiest consequences to the race
of men in that country from the establishment you
have made among them, and I think it very probable
that they will make more rapid progress in the knowledge
and practice of Christianity and civilization than
any heathen nation to whom the gospel has been
preached. May you live to see this verified!</p>

<p>&#8220;With cordial and earnest wishes for your health
and prosperity, I remain, dear Sir, with sincere regard,</p>

<p>&#8220;Your faithful and humble friend and servant,</p>

<p class="quotsig">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gambier</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Simeon, of Cambridge, wrote to him in the same strain of encouragement:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Dec. 15, 1819.</p>

<p>&#8220;Last summer I was at Hull, and saw Mr. Scott
and other of your friends and relatives. It was a
joy to me to see how ardent was their love towards
you. I commissioned Mrs. Scott to tell you, in
general terms, that your character and cause were duly
appreciated by the government and by the House of
Commons. I take for granted that Mr. Wilberforce
has given you particulars. It was from him that I
was enabled to declare the general result.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am overwhelmed almost with work. Eleven
volumes will be out in the spring. The first six will
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 127]</span>make their appearance in less than a month; it is of
the same nature as my former work, though distinct
from it. It is on all the finest passages from Genesis
to Revelation. It is entitled &#8216;Hor Homiletic,&#8217;
as being homilies for the assistance both of clergy and
laity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In this age of &#8220;reformatories,&#8221; when the treatment
of our prisoners has become a popular question, it is
impossible to read without deep interest such letters
as the following. Mr. Marsden had taken up the
cause of the degraded female prisoners in New South
Wales. Mrs. Fry in England hears of his benevolent
exertions, and hastens to express her joy; and thus she
writes to the prison-philanthropist of the southern
world:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Mildred&#8217;s Court, second month, 11th, 1820.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Respected Friend</span>,&mdash;I have received thy letters,
one sent by Deputy-commissary-general Allan, and the
other written some time before, but only arrived
within a day or two of each other. I am sorry that I
happened to be out when Deputy-commissary-general
Allan called, but I hope soon to see him, and to
consult with him as to the steps best to be taken to
improve the condition of the female convicts in New
South Wales. Much influence has already been used
here, and the subject has been brought before the
House of Commons. I some time ago obtained a copy
of thy letter to the governor of New South Wales, and
the information contained in it has been much spread
in this country, and it is quite my opinion that some
beneficial alterations will in time take place; but the
present parliament being so soon to be dissolved,
owing to the death of the king, I fear will retard their
progress; but much is doing in this country, and I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span>trust that much is likely to be done. Many of us are
deeply interested in the welfare of the poor convicts
as to their situation here, and their voyage, and when
they arrive in Botany Bay. And if life and ability be
granted us, I trust that much will in time be
accomplished; but all these things require patience
and perseverance, which I hope we shall be endowed
with, both here and on your side of the water. I am
sorry thou hast had so many trials and discouragements
in filling thy very important station, and I cannot help
hoping and believing that thy labours will prove not
to be in vain; and even if thou shouldst not fully see
the fruit of thy labours, others, I trust, will reap the
advantage of them, so that the words of Scripture may
be verified, &#8216;That both he that soweth and he that
reapeth may rejoice together.&#8217; I consider myself
greatly obliged by thy valuable communications, and I
think it would be very desirable that thou shouldst let
us know exactly what sort of place is wanted for the
women, and what would be its probable expense, as it
would enable us more clearly to state what we wish
for. And I should think our government would give
the necessary directions to have the work done. I
remain, etc., thy friend, <span class="smcap">Elizabeth Fry</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Through such toils and conflicts our predecessors of
the last generation passed, before they could lay
effectually the foundations of those great principles of
humanity and justice in the public mind, which are
now yielding their abundant fruit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<blockquote><p>Tooi and Teterree&mdash;Mr. Marsden&#8217;s Second Voyage to New Zealand&mdash;Progress
of the Gospel there&mdash;Shunghie&mdash;His ferocity&mdash;Mr.
Marsden returns to New South Wales&mdash;Third Voyage to New Zealand&mdash;Malicious
charges brought against him in his absence&mdash;A
Commission of Inquiry&mdash;Its result&mdash;Letters, etc.&mdash;Approbation of
the Government.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 130]</span>The New Zealand mission still continued to occupy
Mr. Marsden&#8217;s thoughts. He seems to have been
always alert, turning every hint to account, seizing
every occasion and employing every likely instrument
to promote the grand design. The excellent quality
of the New Zealand flax had not escaped him. He
induced two young New Zealanders, whom he had
brought with him to Paramatta, to visit England,
which they did in H. M. ship Kangaroo, and were
placed under the care of his friends in London. &#8220;I
wish on no account,&#8221; he writes to Mr. Pratt, &#8220;that
they should be idle; if they cannot be useful in
forming a vocabulary, (of the Maori language of which
he was now anxious that a grammar should be prepared)
let them be <i>put into a rope walk</i>, and be kept
close to labour while they remain in England.&#8221; They
were both chieftains, Tooi and Teterree; still the
reader must not suppose the rope walk was to them a
degrading employment. Mr. Marsden had another
object in view besides their improvement, and he
wished to impart to his friends in London something
of his own enthusiasm in behalf of the Maorie race.
&#8220;The Society will see,&#8221; he says in his letter to the
secretary, Mr. Pratt, &#8220;from these two young men
what the natives of New Zealand are. They are
prepared to receive any instruction that we can give
them; they are fine young men, and in temper and
natural parts very like their countrymen in general.&#8221;
They seem to have deserved the character here given
them. We insert a letter from each, written while
they were in England. The first is addressed to Mr.
Pratt while Tooi was on a visit amongst the manufactories
of Staffordshire and Shropshire.</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Madeley, Sept. 17, 1818.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am much obliged and thank you,
Mr. Pratt, for the letter you sent me. I so pleased
when Mr. Pratt finds a ship. I want a ship to go
home. I have been to Coalport. I made four cups.
Mr. Rose tell me, &#8216;You soon learn.&#8217; &#8216;Yes,&#8217; I say,
&#8216;very soon learn with fingers, but book very hard,&#8217; etc.</p>

<p>&#8220;To Mr. Pratt.</p>
<p class="quotsig"><span class="smcap">Thomas Tooi</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The other letter is in a graver strain from Teterreeto Mr. Marsden.</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Church Missionary House, October 12, 1818.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I like Englishman much; he
love New Zealand man. I very sick in missionary
house, and very near die; nothing but bone. Kind
friend missionary pray for me every night.</p>

<p>&#8220;I kneel down in my bed-room every night, and
pray to Jesus Christ our Saviour to learn me to read
the book.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very nice country England. I never see the
king of England; he very poorly, and Queen Charlotte
very poorly too.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see the iron make, and bottle blow. Tooi blow
a bottle, and I blow a bottle. I make four cups at
China work, etc. Farewell, good friend.</p>

<p class="quotsig">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Teteree</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 131]</span>Their English education being completed, the young
chieftains returned to Paramatta, and Mr. Marsden
embarked a second time for New Zealand, taking Tooi
and Teterree with him, with several missionaries, three
mechanics and their families. They landed at
Rangheehoa, in the Bay of Islands, on the 12th
August. The rival chiefs Shunghie and Koro-Koro
now contended for the site of the new missionary
settlement which Mr. Marsden contemplated, each
being anxious that his own domain should be preferred,
and offering a grant of land. The spot was
selected at Kiddee Kiddee (or Keri-Keri) a district in
the territory of Shunghie, at the head of a fine
harbour; but such was the distress of the disappointed
chieftain, whose part was taken by young Tooi, that
Mr. Marsden almost relented: &#8220;He made strong
appeals to our feelings, and urged his request by every
argument that he could advance, so that we were
obliged to promise to accompany him on the next day
to Parroa, and that we would build him and Tooi a
house if the situation pleased us, and send one or two
Europeans to reside amongst them.&#8221; The stores were
now landed, and all the beach exhibited a scene of
happiness and busy civilization; fourteen natives
sawing timber, others cutting knees, etc.; &#8220;a sight
more grateful to a benevolent mind could not possibly
have been seen; our hearts overflowed with gratitude.
We viewed the various operations with delight, and
considered them the dawn of civil and religious liberty
to this land of darkness, superstition, and cruelty.&#8221;
Such were the comments which the missionary leader
noted down at the time, and in reading them we are
made to feel how much Christian benevolence excels
the mere selfishness of the most enterprising colonist.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 132]</span>
Simply for the good of others, without the hope or
wish of reaping any other advantage than that of
extending the kingdom of God amongst a savage race,
the little missionary band, self exiled, and consecrated
to a life of unknown toil and hardship, exult in laying
the foundations of their settlement, as the Jews of old
exulted when they began to build their temple to the
living God. On the next sabbath day, the work was
consecrated with prayer and praise. Mr. Marsden&#8217;s
simple language best describes the scene:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;<i>August 22.</i>&mdash;We assembled on the beach for
public worship, as there was no place sufficiently spacious
to hold the people. We were surrounded with
natives and a number of chiefs from different districts.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was gratifying to be able to perform worship to
the true God in the open air, without fear or danger,
when surrounded by cannibals with their spears stuck
in the ground, and their pattoo-pattoos and daggers
concealed under their mats. We could not doubt but
that the time was at hand for gathering in this noble
people into the fold of Christ. Their misery is extreme,
the prince of darkness has full dominion over
their souls and bodies; under the influence of ignorance
and superstition many devote themselves to
death, and the chiefs sacrifice their slaves as a satisfaction
for the death of any of their friends. This is a
tyranny from which nothing but the gospel can set
them free.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<span class="caption">THE BAY OF ISLANDS, NEW ZEALAND</span>
</div>

<p>During this three months&#8217; sojourn, besides the attention
which Mr. Marsden gave to the missions in
the Bay of Islands, he made a circuitous journey of
seven hundred miles, exploring the country with a
view to more extensive operations. His arrival over
land and in health, at the Bay of Islands, on his return,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 133]<br />
[Pg 134]<br />[Pg 135]</span>relieved the minds of his anxious friends the missionaries,
and &#8220;gave them additional cause,&#8221; they
say, &#8220;to bless and thank God for his protecting care,
and that he had again heard and answered our supplications.&#8221;
&#8220;There is not one in ten thousand, I think,&#8221;
writes Mr. Hall, &#8220;who could or would have borne the
privations, difficulties, and dangers, which he has
undergone. I pray that he may reap the fruits of his
labour by the New Zealanders turning from their degraded
state to serve the only living and true God.&#8221;
Mr. Marsden&#8217;s journal of this second visit will be
valuable in time to come, as perhaps the best record
in existence of the character and habits of a wonderful
people, on whom civilization had not yet dawned, and
whose spiritual darkness was profound. He landed,
during a coasting voyage, with young Tooi, on the
small island of Motooroa. &#8220;The first object that
struck my eye was a man&#8217;s head stuck on a pole near
the hut where we were to sleep; the face appeared
beautifully tattooed; it was the head of a chief who
was killed by Shunghie&#8217;s people. The sight,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;naturally excited feelings of horror in my
breast.&#8221; Most men would have felt something of
alarm. But Mr. Marsden seems to have been a perfect
stranger to fear; and if courage, whether physical
or moral, makes a hero, he must be ranked high in the
heroic class. He merely adds, &#8220;This caused me to
value more and more the blessing of Divine revelation,
and the blessing of civil government.&#8221;</p>

<p>In his journal on a tour to the River Shukeangha,
he writes thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;<i>September 28, 1819.</i>&mdash;After we had passed the
swamp, we came into a very open country, for many
miles round covered with fern. The part through<span class="pagenum">[Pg 136]</span>
which we walked was gravelly, and not very good in
general.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wind increased toward evening, and blew
strong from the rainy quarter, so that we had the
prospect of a very wet night, without a single tree to
shelter us from the storm for about eight miles from
the swamp we had passed. At this distance was a
wood, through which our road lay, which we were
anxious to reach, if possible, in order to shelter ourselves
from the wind and rain. With this hope we
pushed forward, and arrived at the edge of the wood
about nine o&#8217;clock. The rain now began to fall heavily.
The natives cut branches of fern and boughs of trees,
and made us a little shed under the trees, to afford us
some shelter. The blackness of the heavens, the
gloomy darkness of the wood, the roaring of the wind
among the trees, the sound of the falling rain on the
thick foliage, united with the idea that we were
literally at the ends of the earth, with relation to our
native land, surrounded with cannibals whom we knew
to have fed on human flesh, and wholly in their power,
and yet our minds free from fear of danger&mdash;all this
excited in my breast such new, pleasing, and, at the
same time, opposite sensations, as I cannot describe.</p>

<p>&#8220;While I sat musing under the shelter of a lofty
pine, my thoughts were lost in wonder and surprise,
in taking a view of the wisdom and goodness of God&#8217;s
providential care, which had attended all my steps to
that very hour. If busy imagination inquired what I
did there, I had no answer to seek in wild conjecture:
I felt with gratitude that I had not come by chance;
but had been sent to labour in preparing the way of
the Lord in this dreary wilderness, where the voice of
joy and gladness had never been heard: and I could<span class="pagenum">[Pg 137]</span>
not but anticipate with joyful hope the period when
the Day-star from on high would dawn and shine on
this dark and heathen land, and cause the very earth
on which we then reposed to bring forth its increase,
when God himself would give the poor inhabitants his
blessing. After reflecting on the different ideas which
crowded themselves upon my mind, I wrapped myself
up in my great coat, and lay down to sleep.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>He visited an island where he met with a singular
spectacle. A number of natives were at work, breaking
up the ground with a sort of spatula, or wooden spade,
to plant their sweet potato. Amongst these was
Koro-Koro&#8217;s head wife, or queen. &#8220;Her Majesty was
working hard with a wooden spade, digging the ground
for potatoes, with several of the women and some men.&#8221;
The royal infant lay on the ground sprawling and
kicking by her side; &#8220;the old queen earnestly requested
that I would give her a hoe, showing me the
difficulty she had in digging with a stick; a request
with which I promised to comply.&#8221; We leave the
reader to admire at leisure the Homeric simplicity of
the scene, or to indulge in those sentiments of contemptuous
pity to which Englishmen are possibly more
prone.</p>

<p>In another place, he found the head wife of Shunghie,
though perfectly blind, digging in the same
manner, surrounded by her women, and apparently
with as much ease as the rest. The offer of a hoe in
exchange for her spatula was accepted with joy. The
scene drew forth these reflections: &#8220;When we viewed
the wife of one of the most military chiefs, possessing
large territories, digging with a spatula for her subsistence,
this sight kindled within us the best feelings
of the human heart. If a woman of this character,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 138]</span>
and blind, can thus labour with her servants, what
will not this people rise to, if they can procure the
means of improving their country, and of bettering
their condition? Their temporal state must be improved
by agriculture and the simple arts, in connexion
with the introduction of Christianity, in order
to give permanence and full influence to the gospel
among them. Our God and Saviour, who is loving to
every man, and whose tender mercies are over all his
works, is now, blessed be his name, moving the hearts
of his servants to send relief to the poor heathen, even
to the very ends of the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The journal affords us repeated evidences of a phenomenon,
which recent occurrences in India have at
this moment deeply impressed on the heart of England,&mdash;one
with which both divines and legislators
ought to have been acquainted (for it is not obscurely
referred to in the word of God), but which a foolish
and spurious benevolence has led many to deny&mdash;namely,
that the most Satanic ferocity frequently lurks
under gentle manners, and is even to be found in connexion
with the warmest natural affection. Nothing,
for instance, can be more affecting than the meeting
of Tooi and his sister, after the absence of the former
in England. Tooi himself anticipated <i>a scene</i>, and
half ashamed, when he saw his sister at a distance,
tried to avoid the interview in public, and requested
Mr. Marsden to order off the canoe in which they
were approaching. But her love could not be restrained;
in an instant she sprang into the boat, fell
on her knees, and clung to Tooi. He saluted her in
return; when she gave vent to her feelings in tears
and loud lamentations, which she continued for about
an hour. &#8220;Tooi conducted himself with great pro<span class="pagenum">[Pg 139]</span>priety,
suppressing all his wild feelings, and at the
same time treating his sister with all the soft and
tender feelings of nature. I could not but view his
conduct with admiration.&#8221; When Tooi was in England,
he had been taught to read and write, and instructed
in the doctrines of Christianity; and he and
his companion Teterree were general favourites, from
their gentle manners and quick intelligence. They
were one day taken to St. Paul&#8217;s by Mr. Nicholas,
who naturally supposed they would be lost in astonishment
at the grandeur of the building, but they expressed
neither surprise nor pleasure; on which that
gentleman makes this just remark; &#8220;It is only things
of common occurrence, I suspect, that strike the
mind of a savage. The faculties must be cultivated to
fit them for the enjoyment of the beautiful or the
sublime.&#8221; One thing, however, did strike them, and
caused no small excitement. In walking up Fleet-street,
they suddenly stopped before a hair-dresser&#8217;s
shop, in the window of which were some female busts.
They screamed out &#8220;Wyenee! Wyenee!&#8221; (Women!
Women!) taking them for dried heads of the human
subject. &#8220;I took some pains,&#8221; adds their kind conductor,
&#8220;to beat this notion out of them, lest they
should tell their countrymen on their return that
Europeans preserved human heads as well as New
Zealanders.&#8221;</p>

<p>These bursts of feeling were, it seems, quite natural;
intense sorrow or savage exultation, the extremes of
tenderness and of brutality, were indulged by turns,
without any suspicion on their part of insincerity in
either. Immediately after, Mr. Marsden mentions
that he passed a canoe in which he recognised an old
acquaintance, Hooratookie, the first New Zealander<span class="pagenum">[Pg 140]</span>
introduced into civil society&mdash;Governor King having
once entertained him with great kindness. Hooratookie
was grateful; spoke of the governor&#8217;s daughter,
then a child, with unfeigned regard, calling her by her
Christian name, Maria. But looking into his large
war-canoe, capable of holding from sixty to eighty
men, with provisions, Mr. Marsden observed on the
stern the dried head of a chief. &#8220;The face was as
natural as life, the hair was long, and every lock
combed straight, and the whole brought up to the
crown, tied in a knot, and ornamented with feathers,
according to the custom of the chiefs when in full
dress. It was placed there as an incentive to revenge.
It is possible the death of this chief may be revenged
by his children&#8217;s children; hence the foundation is
laid for new acts of cruelty and blood from generation
to generation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Marsden&#8217;s fame now preceded him, and wherever
he went, he was received not with rude hospitality,
but with courteous respect. One chieftain offered up
an ovation and prayer on their arrival. &#8220;He invoked
the heavens above and the earth beneath to render
our visit advantageous to his people, and agreeable to
us, and that no harm may happen to us, whom he
esteemed as the gods of another country. We heard
the profane adulations with silent grief, and could not
but wish most ardently for the light of Divine truth to
shine on such a dark and superstitious mind.&#8221; Yet
this man was a ferocious cannibal; and when Mr.
Marsden expressed his anxiety for the safety of the
missionaries after he should have left them, he was
calmed by the assurance that, as we had done them no
harm, they had no satisfaction to demand, &#8220;and that
as for eating us, the flesh of a New Zealander was<span class="pagenum">[Pg 141]</span>
sweeter than that of an European, in consequence of
the white people eating so much salt.&#8221; From this the
conversation turned to that of eating human flesh,
which they defended with arguments which to them
appeared, no doubt, perfectly conclusive. They alleged
that fishes, animals, and birds, preyed upon each other;
and that one god would devour another god, therefore
there was in nature sufficient warrant for the practice.
Shunghie explained how it was the gods preyed on
each other, &#8220;and that when he was to the southward,
and had killed a number of people and was afraid of
their god, he caught their god, being a reptile, and
ate part of it, and reserved the remainder for his
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shunghie, the greatest of New Zealand warriors,
was at the same time a striking instance of that union
of gentleness and ferocity which characterized this
people. To the missionaries his kindness was always
great, and his respect for Mr. Marsden knew no bounds.
An instance of his good feeling may here be noticed.
In the beginning of 1817, a naval expedition, under
his command, sailed from the Bay of Islands. It consisted
of thirty canoes, and about eight hundred men.
Its object was to obtain peace with his enemies at the
North Cape. The chief took an affectionate leave of
the settlers, and told them that if he fell they must be
kind to his children; and if he survived, he would
take care of their families when they should die. The
expedition returned, however, in about a fortnight,
his people having quarrelled with those of Wangaroa,
into which place they had put for refreshment; and
being afraid, he said, that the Wangaroa people would
attack the settlers in his absence, he, for the present,
abandoned the expedition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 142]</span>Shunghie was again preparing for war when Mr.
Marsden paid his second visit to New Zealand; his
army, to the number of several thousand men, were
already assembled; his war-canoes were ready, and
all his preparations complete; yet in deference to the
remonstrances of Mr. Marsden, he again abandoned
his scheme of conquest or revenge, and dismissed his
followers.</p>

<p>Shunghie paid a visit to England about the year
1820. His majestic person, graceful manners, and
gentle yet manly disposition were much admired. He
was one of Nature&#8217;s nobles; what might not be expected
from such a man when he returned home again?
George the Fourth invited him to Carlton Palace, and
received him with marked attention, presenting him
with some military accoutrements and costly fire-arms.
Yet the heart of a savage never ceased to beat beneath
this polished exterior, while his pride was fanned to
madness by the consideration he received in England.
&#8220;There is,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;but one king in England;
there shall be only one king in New Zealand.&#8221; Returning
by way of Sydney he there happened to meet
with Inacki, another chief, with whom he had an
ancient feud. He told him that when they got back
to New Zealand he would fight him. Inacki accepted
the challenge, and Shunghie accordingly assembled,
on his return to New Zealand, no fewer than two
thousand men to attack Inacki. The latter was
prepared to receive him, and for some time the
event of the battle that ensued was doubtful. At
length Shunghie, who had the greatest number of
muskets, and who had arranged his men in the form
called, in Roman tactics, the cuneus, or wedge, placing
himself at the apex and directing those behind him to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 143]</span>
wheel round the enemy, from the right and left, or to
fall back into their original position as opportunity
offered, shot Inacki. The savage Shunghie immediately
sprang forward, scooped out the eye of the dying man
with his knife, and swallowed it; and then, holding
his hands to his throat, into which he had plunged his
knife, and from which the blood flowed copiously,
drank as much of the horrid beverage as the two hands
could hold. Amongst the horrible superstitions of
the Maories, one was that the eye of a victim thus
devoured became a star in the firmament, and thus
the ferocious Shunghie sought for honour and immortality.
With the sword which he had received as a
present from King George in England, he immediately
cut off the heads of sixteen of his captives in cold
blood; this was done to appease the spirit of his son-in-law,
who had fallen in battle. In this battle, Shunghie
and his tribe were armed with muskets, his opponents
only with the native weapons, the club and spear.
His victory, therefore, was an easy one, but his revenge
was cruel. A New Zealand traveller, who visited the
spot in 1844, says: &#8220;The bones of two thousand men
still lie whitening on the plain, and the ovens remain
in which the flesh of the slaughtered was cooked for
the horrible repasts of the victorious party, and yet so
numerous were the slaves taken prisoners that the
Nga-Puis (the tribe of which Shunghie was the head)
killed many of them on their way to the Bay of Islands
merely to get rid of them.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> Such was the gentle
Shunghie when his viler nature was let loose&mdash;a
frightful specimen of human nature, varnished by
education, but unvisited by the grace of God. We
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 144]</span>turn aside for a moment to describe a scene in bright
contrast with these revolting details. Amongst the
few who escaped the general slaughter was Koromona,
a chief who became blind soon afterwards, but
hearing archdeacon W. Williams preach at Matamata,
was converted. &#8220;For the last four years,&#8221;
says the traveller above mentioned, &#8220;Koromona has
been a native teacher, and may be seen every sabbath
day with his class instructing them in the
truths of the Scripture with an earnestness which is
truly admirable; he is now about to start to preach
Christianity to a tribe which has not yet received it.
His memory is wonderful; he knows the whole of the
church service by heart, and repeats hymns and many
long chapters verbatim.&#8221; Thus the gospel won its victorious
way, and proved itself triumphant over hearts no
less depraved and passions no less degraded than those
of Shunghie himself. No earthly power could have
effected such a change; it was wrought by that
&#8220;gospel&#8221; which is truly &#8220;the power of God unto
salvation to every one that believeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amidst such scenes the missionaries dwelt in peace.
War, and its inseparable and more hideous companion,
cannibalism, showed themselves at their gates, but
were not allowed to hurt them. Under the good
providence of God, their security was owing, in a great
measure, to the prudence and courage with which
Mr. Marsden planned and carried out his projects.
Himself a stranger to fear, he infused courage into
those around him, and both he and they felt secure
under the shield and buckler of the Almighty. No
doubt the fearlessness of Mr. Marsden won the admiration
of these savages and contributed not a little to
his safety. His journal abounds in instances such as<span class="pagenum">[Pg 145]</span>
that which follows. The scene is in a Maori village,
and the writer is surrounded with cannibals. &#8220;After
conversing on several subjects, we had supper, sung a
hymn, and then committed ourselves to the Angel of
the everlasting covenant, and so lay down to rest; a
number of the natives lay around the hut and some
within. I slept well until daybreak, being weary
with walking.&#8221;</p>

<p>He appears to have arrived at home, after this
second visit to New Zealand, towards the close of
November, 1819. In February, 1820, he was once
more on his way back to New Zealand. His letters
bear ample testimony to a fact which all who were
acquainted with him in private life observed, that his
heart was full of affection, and that his home was the
scene of his greatest happiness. He had not returned,
it is true, to be greeted with public honours; on the
contrary, he was still a marked man. The governor
and many of the leading men in the colony were
prejudiced against him. We believe it is to this
period of his life that an anecdote which we give on
the best possible authority belongs. The governor
had consented to his recent visit to New Zealand with
reluctance, and had limited the period of his absence
with military precision, threatening at the same time
to deprive him of his chaplaincy unless he returned
within the given time. The last day arrived, and the
expected vessel was not in sight. The governor
repeated his determination to those around him, and
Mr. Marsden&#8217;s friends were filled with anxiety, and
his wife and family at length gave up all hope. Towards
evening the long-wished-for sail appeared in the offing,
and at eight o&#8217;clock in the evening Mr. Marsden quietly
walked into the governor&#8217;s drawing-room with the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 146]</span>
laconic and yet respectful address, &#8220;Sir, I am here to
report myself.&#8221; But within the bosom of his family
all was peace, and his presence shed light and joy on
everything around him. His circumstances were
prosperous&mdash;for his farm, which was almost entirely
committed to Mrs. Marsden&#8217;s care, was now a source
of considerable income; his children were growing up
to manhood under their parents&#8217; roof; his circle of
friends and visitors was large, for there were no bounds
to his simple hospitality; and the clergy of the colony,
men like minded with himself, had now begun to
regard him not only with affection, but with the
reverence which belongs to years and wisdom and
wide experience.</p>

<p>Yet at the call of duty this veteran was ready, on
the shortest notice, to resume a life of such toil and
hardship as nothing could have rendered welcome, its
novelty once over, but motives the most solemn and
commanding. H.M.S. Dromedary, Captain Skinner,
was directed by government to proceed from Sydney
to the Bay of Islands to receive a cargo of New Zealand
timber for trial in the dockyards of England; and Sir
Byam Martin, controller of the navy, knowing something
of the energy of Mr. Marsden&#8217;s character, and
his great acquaintance with New Zealand, requested
that he would accompany the Dromedary, which
was joined by the Coromandel, in order to facilitate
the object of their visit. With this request he felt it
his duty to comply. He arrived in New Zealand on
the 20th of February, and embarked on board the
Dromedary to return on the 25th of November.
Thus nearly the whole year was given to the service
of New Zealand.</p>

<p>The time was not lost. On his arrival, a difficulty<span class="pagenum">[Pg 147]</span>
occurred which he only could have set at rest. The
natives had come to the determination to exchange
nothing, nor to do any kind of work, except for muskets
and powder. His first business was to assemble the
few European settlers, the advanced guard of that
mighty band of European colonists which was soon to
follow, and to persuade them not on any account to
supply the natives with these weapons of war, in their
hands so sure a source of mischief. With regard to
the duty of the missionaries there could be no doubt;
and this he explained to all the powerful chiefs. They
had come among them to preach the gospel of peace,
how then could they be expected to furnish the means
and implements of destruction? In writing to the
Missionary Society at home he says, and he must have
written such a sentence with an aching heart, &#8220;I
think it much more to the honour of religion and the
good of New Zealand even to give up the mission for
the present, than to trade with the natives in those
articles.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a short time spent in the Bay of Islands, at
the mission, he proceeded, sometimes in company with
Europeans, but for the most part alone, upon a tour
of many hundred miles through regions yet untrodden
by the foot of civilized men, mingling with the native
tribes, accompanying them in their wanderings from
place to place, teaching the first lessons of civilization
and gospel truth, and receiving everywhere from these
savages the kindest attention and the most hospitable
welcome in return.</p>

<p>On their way to Tourangha, he writes, under the
date of June 20: &#8220;The day was far spent when we
reached the plain. We walked on till the sun was
nearly set, when we stopped and prepared for the night.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 148]</span>
The servants, who had the provisions to carry, were
very tired. There were no huts on the plain, nor
any inhabitants, and we were therefore compelled to
take up our lodging in the open air. I was very
weary, having had no rest the preceding night; and
having come a long day&#8217;s journey, so that I felt that
rest would be very acceptable, even on a heap of fern
or anything else.</p>

<p>&#8220;The peculiar scene that surrounded me, furnished
the mind with new matter for contemplation on the
works and ways of God. The mystery of his providence,
and the still greater mystery of his grace,
were all unsearchable to me. I had come from a
distant country, and was then at the ends of the earth,
a solitary individual, resting on an extensive wild,
upon which no civilized foot had ever before trodden.
My companions were poor savages, who nevertheless
vied with each other in their attentions to me. I could
not but feel attached to them. What would I have
given to have had the book of life opened, which was
yet a sealed book to them,&mdash;to have shown them that
God who made them, and to have led them to
Calvary&#8217;s mount, that they may see the Redeemer who
had shed his precious blood for the redemption of the
world, and was there set up as an ensign for the
nations. But it was not in my power to take the
veil from their hearts, I could only pray for them, and
entreat the Father of mercies to visit them with his
salvation. I felt very grateful that a Divine revelation
had been granted to me; that I knew the Son
of God had come, and believed that he had made a
full and sufficient sacrifice or atonement for the
sins of a guilty world. With compassionate feelings
for my companions, under a grateful sense of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 149]</span>
my own mercies, I lay down to rest, free from all fear
of danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was during this tour that the following letter
was addressed to the lady of his excellent friend Dr.
Mason Good. It is long, but the reader will scarcely
wish that it had been shorter. Let it stand on record
as an evidence of the power of true religion in maintaining
amidst the rudest scenes, and the rough
warfare of an adventurous life, all the gentleness and
affection of the most refined and polished society of a
Christian land.</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;New Zealand, Sept. 22, 1820.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,&mdash;Your kind favour arrived in the
Bay of Islands September 7, the evening I returned
from a long journey. I had no sooner cast my eye
over your letter, than busy imagination transported
me from the solitary woods, dreary wastes, and savage
society of New Zealand, into &#8216;the polished corner&#8217; of
Guilford-street, and surrounded me with every cordial
that could refresh the weary traveller, revive the
fainting spirits, and blow the languishing spark of
Christian love with a heavenly flame. I had literally
been living for weeks a savage life, as far as outward
circumstances went. I ate, I slept in the thick wood,
in a cave, or on the banks of a river, or sea, with my
native companions, wherever the shadows of the
evening, or gathering storm compelled us to seek for
shelter. Every day as I advanced from tribe to tribe,
I was introduced to new acquaintances; my object
was to gain from observation and experience that
knowledge of savage life which I could not learn from
books, and to make myself well acquainted with the
wants, wishes, and character of the native inhabitants,
to enable me, if my life should be spared, to aid to the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 150]</span>utmost of my power in their deliverance from their
present temporal miseries, which are great upon them,
and from their much sorer bondage to the prince of
darkness. I am happy in having obtained this object
to a certain extent, at the expense of a few temporal
privations, and a little bodily evil. When I have lain
down upon the ground after a weary day&#8217;s journey,
wrapped up in my great coat, surrounded only by
cannibals, I often thought how many thousands are
there in civil life, languishing upon beds of down, and
saying, with Job, &#8216;in the evening would God it were
morning,&#8217; while I could sleep free from fear or pain,
far remote from civil society under the guardian care
of him who keepeth Israel. Though I everywhere
met with the greatest kindness from the natives, as
well as hospitality, for they always gave me the best
fern-root, potato, or fish in their possession, yet I
could never have duly estimated the sweets of civil
life, and the still greater mental gratification of
Christian communion, if I had not passed through
these dark regions of Satan&#8217;s dominions, on which the
dayspring from on high hath never cast a single ray.
You cannot conceive how great a feast your letter
was, after so long a fast. I was instantly present
with every person you mentioned, and lived over again
some of those happy moments I once spent under
your hospitable roof. A sacred warmth flowed round
my soul, my heart was sweetly melted under the
influence of that pure and undefiled religion which
dropped from your pen, like the heavenly dew, as it ran
through every line. What shall we call those pure
sensations that thus warm and captivate the soul?
Do they flow from the communion of saints, or at
these delightful moments does some invisible seraph<span class="pagenum">[Pg 151]</span>
touch our lips with a live coal from God&#8217;s altar? If
you have ever experienced similar feelings, their
recollection will explain more fully my meaning than
my words can express. When these lines meet your
eye, may they find your soul rapt up to the third
heaven! But to where am I now wandering? the veil
of the flesh is not now rent, we have not yet entered
into the holy of holies. Though God has given you
and your seed the land of Goshen, and you have light
continually in your dwelling, yet you are still in
Egypt, while I am constrained to dwell in Mesech,
and to dwell in these remote and dark tents of Kedar.
But, my dear madam, seas and continents will not
long separate the people of God. I humbly hope the
day is at no great distance, when we shall join the
spirits of just men made perfect. At present you
abound with blessings.... Jacob often
thought of Bethel, and when in his afflictions he
seemed to have forgotten that sacred spot, God said
unto him, &#8216;Arise and go to Bethel, and dwell there.&#8217;
It will always be safest for us to dwell also at Bethel.
I must now close, as my paper is nearly full, and your
patience must also be tired when it comes to your
turn to read what I have written.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember me to your sister, Mrs. Skinner. Tell
Mr. Good I received his last letter, and will answer it
at a more convenient season. I was on my passage to
Port Jackson in a small schooner, but adverse winds
drove me back almost dead with sea-sickness. I have
been here since February last, and when I shall get
home I am uncertain; I venture no more in the
schooner. Mrs. M. wants me back, as she has much
upon her hands. It gave me great satisfaction to
hear my son had arrived safe. I knew your kindness<span class="pagenum">[Pg 152]</span>
would far exceed my wishes. I will endeavour, as
far as able, to pay all my debts when I see Mr.
Good and you face to face; till then you must give me
credit, and if I do not pay you, you will be sure to
receive both principal and interest in the resurrection
of the just.</p>

<p class="quotsig">&#8220;I remain, dear madam,<br />
&#8220;Yours, in the bonds of Christian love,<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Samuel Marsden</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The immediate object of his visit being accomplished,
he returned to Sydney, where a strange reception
awaited him. Governor Macquarie had sent
to Lord Bathurst a despatch in answer to the statements
of the senior chaplain, already noticed, in which
he brought heavy charges against the latter, which
deeply affected his character, not only as a magistrate,
but as a Christian man and a minister. The office of
a magistrate he had been compelled to undertake in
common with the other clergy of the colony, who were
all included in the commission of the peace. For this
there was no justification except hard necessity. Mr.
Marsden, however, had long been weary of the irksome
task, and had once and again requested the
governor to accept his resignation. This the governor
had expressly declined to do, on the ground that &#8220;his
services as a magistrate were too beneficial to the
public;&#8221; but in fact, it would seem, only that he
might have the opportunity of inflicting upon him the
annoyance of a formal dismissal, which was shortly
afterwards notified in the &#8220;Sydney Gazette.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Bathurst, in consequence of the governor&#8217;s
despatch, determined upon a step which gave great
satisfaction to Mr. Marsden&#8217;s friends at home, and
sent out a commissioner to investigate upon the spot<span class="pagenum">[Pg 153]</span>
the truth of these and various other matters affecting
the state of the colony, which had now obtained public
notoriety, and had already engaged the attention of
the British parliament; and Commissioner Bigge
arrived during Mr. Marsden&#8217;s absence to manage the
inquiry. On his return we find him seeking a public
and searching examination of his whole conduct.
Addressing a letter to the commissioner, he says: &#8220;I
am happy to meet every charge that can be brought
against me. I have no wish to do more than set my
character right in the opinion of his Majesty&#8217;s government
and in that of the Christian world; and I am
unfeignedly thankful to you for the fair opportunity
you afford me to justify my public and private conduct.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among the many charges brought before the commission
of inquiry was that already preferred against
Mr. Marsden by the governor in his despatch to Lord
Bathurst, namely, that he had been guilty of extraordinary
severity as a magistrate. Another, scarcely
consistent with the first, was, that more profligacy
and depravity were to be found amongst the convicts
of Paramatta than in any other district, and
that this was owing to the neglect of the senior
chaplain. Perhaps it would have been impossible to
have brought forward any two charges of a more painful
nature. Happily the first was easily disproved, or
rather it fell at once to the ground for want of proof.
The second was the more cruel, because, while the
facts bore out the statement, Mr. Marsden was the only
public man in the colony who was not guilty, by his
silence at least, to some extent of the iniquities which
the governor affected to deplore. Paramatta was, in
fact, the receptacle of the most hardened and depraved<span class="pagenum">[Pg 154]</span>
of the convict class; it received the sweepings of the
jails in every district. There were nearly two hundred
women and seven hundred male convicts there,
while the factory was so small as not to be able to
contain more than sixty women, and the remainder
were obliged to find lodging for themselves or to sleep
in the open fields. This was Mr. Marsden&#8217;s answer
to the commissioner; it was a repetition of the remonstrance
which he alone had had the courage, two years
before, to present to the governor, and then to remit
home to England. Thus he found himself arraigned
as the cause of those very evils&mdash;evils, too, lying at
his own door&mdash;which he had obtained so much obloquy
for attempting to remove. The reflection is a trite
one, but it will bear to be repeated, that the Christian
philanthropist must look for his recompense in heaven,
and not from man. &#8220;If when ye do well and suffer
for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with
God, for even hereunto were ye called.&#8221; A third
charge was that he had squandered public money in
building the female orphan house. He showed, however,
on his defence, that the lieutenant-governor,
judge-advocate, and others, who formed the committee,
had examined the accounts and passed them
every quarter, and that the governor had himself
afterwards approved of them, and published them in
the &#8220;Sydney Gazette&#8221; three years before the charge
was made. It now appeared further that Mr. Marsden
had advanced largely to the institution; to the amount
indeed of more than eight hundred pounds, for the
mere cost of the building; &#8220;and this,&#8221; he says, &#8220;must
have been known to the governor, as I was obliged to
apply to him for repayment for some of these sums, and
received an answer that he could not assist me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 155]</span>Such are some of the trials which they must learn
to encounter who would be brave and fearless soldiers
of the cross. They must expect to have their motives
censured, their tempers blamed, their actions misconstrued,
sometimes by men as good, or, at least, as
honest as themselves. Governor Macquarie left the impression
of his genius upon the youthful institutions of
Australia, where his memory is still honoured as that of
a great man; yet his conduct to Mr. Marsden was oppressive
and unjust. It is consoling to know that there
had been nothing in the personal conduct of the latter
unworthy of his sacred calling. The commissioner, in
the conclusion of the investigation, inserts, for Mr.
Marsden&#8217;s information, the governor&#8217;s testimonial of
his character, which, considering the charges brought
against him, certainly does go far to prove that misapprehension
and exasperated feelings had betrayed
his excellency into a warmth and precipitancy of
which, in moments of less irritation, he felt ashamed.
&#8220;The governor admits that Mr. Marsden&#8217;s manner to
him has been constantly civil and accommodating, and
that nothing in his manner could provoke the governor&#8217;s
warmth. The governor admits his qualifications,
his activity, and his unremitting vigilance as
a magistrate, and in society his cheerful disposition
and readiness to please.&#8221;</p>

<p>While this inquiry was pending at Sydney, the
governor addressed a letter to Lord Sidmouth, and
published it in England. It was a defence of his own
line of policy against various attacks which had been
made against it in the House of Commons by the
Hon. H. Grey Bennett and others. In the course of
his defence, the governor not only ridiculed Mr. Marsden&#8217;s
letter on the necessity of a female factory, and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 156]</span>
his account of the melancholy condition of the convict
women, but charges him with being himself accustomed
to traffic in spirituous liquors, and in consequence
of being displeased at having so many public-houses
in his neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Malicious, and absurd as the accusation was, carrying
with it its own refutation, it found some who
were weak or wicked enough to believe, or however to
repeat it. It was revived in the colony, and republished
in one of the Sydney newspapers after Mr. Marsden&#8217;s
death. Such is the tenacity of slander. &#8220;Only throw
mud enough,&#8221; says the eloquent Mr. Burke, &#8220;and
some of it will be sure to stick.&#8221; Mr. Marsden felt
his character so seriously compromised that he wrote
home to the minister in self-defence, and also addressed
a statement of the case to the new governor, Sir
Thomas Brisbane. After showing the absurdity, and
indeed the impossibility, of the charge, since, in the
first place, the governor himself had granted a monopoly
to certain contractors to purchase and land all spirits
brought to the colony, and that in the second he had
no licence, he adds: &#8220;Such is the watchful eye that was
kept upon my whole conduct by night and by day, if
I had been guilty of that or any other impropriety, it
would have been impossible for me to have escaped
detection.&#8221; So far as any pretence of truth could
have been urged in support of this foul slander,
namely that &#8220;he kept a public-house for the sale of
ardent spirits, selling them in any quantity from a pint
to a puncheon,&#8221; it may be stated in his own words:
&#8220;In the infancy of the colony, previously to my arrival,
barter was established among all classes from the
governor downwards. As there was neither beer nor
milk, tea nor sugar, to be purchased at any price,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 157]</span>
wine and spirits became the medium of exchange.
As the colony progressively advanced in agriculture,
commerce, and wealth, barter gradually decreased, and
money transactions became more general. I can affirm
that for the last eighteen years I have not had in my
possession as much spirits as would allow my servants
half a pint a head per week. And at no period
of my residence did I ever purchase spirits for sale.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>

<p>These were not the only troubles through which he
was called to pass. But enough has been said both
to explain the difficulties in which Mr. Marsden was
placed and to clear his character from the vile aspersions
cast upon it. It is with pleasure that we turn
from these false and disgraceful charges to follow him
in those Christian and philanthropic pursuits which
have given splendour to his name.</p>

<p>On the arrival of Sir Thomas Brisbane, in 1821, to
assume the government of New South Wales, Mr.
Marsden immediately waited upon him, when he
received the assurance of his countenance and support,
not only as a colonial chaplain, but as the representative
of the great missionary work going forward in
New Zealand. Such encouragement was opportune;
he thanked God and took courage; for the difficulties
were great, and from time to time grievous disappointments
and vexations had occurred. It was about this
time that the seminary at Paramatta, for the education
of New Zealanders, was abandoned. It had its origin
with Mr. Marsden, and was conducted for some time
in his own house. It was indeed one of his most
favourite plans, and its failure was a severe disappointment.
It was found, however, that the change
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 158]</span>of habits and of climate was injurious to the health of
the New Zealanders, while the results were not always
such as might have been desired. But nothing could
damp his ardent zeal, or quench his spirit of enterprise.
&#8220;I see,&#8221; he says, writing to his friends at
home, &#8220;the way preparing for the spread of the gospel.
I feel the fullest conviction that the South Sea Islands
will now receive the blessing of civilization and the
gospel. The work is great, and many difficulties may
oppose it. The foundation is now firmly laid, and
no power on earth can overturn it. To impart these
blessings to the New Zealanders is an object worthy
of the British nation: a more noble undertaking
could not be suggested to the Christian world.&#8221;
This at least was not the mere declamation of the
platform, but the deliberate expression of the views
of one who had toiled and suffered in the cause for
twenty years, and had scarcely been cheered, at
present, with the sight of a single New Zealand convert.
&#8220;Here,&#8221; at least, &#8220;is the patience of the
saints.&#8221;</p>

<p>His home duties were not neglected; nor was his
the easy philanthropy which overlooks the humble
claims of the rustic flock or obscure parish, while it
stalks abroad on some heroic enterprise which may feed
the vanity, while it satisfies the conscience, of the
actor. Through his exertions Paramatta had now its
association in behalf of the Bible Society, which already
collected funds for the Parent Society in England.
An early report from this institution contains a remarkable
account of his visits to the sick bed of a
young woman, whose experience beautifully illustrates
the text, that the Scripture &#8220;is able to make us wise
unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.&#8221;<span class="pagenum">[Pg 159]</span>
It brings the writer also before us incidentally as a
spiritual pastor and an enlightened minister of Christ.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some time ago,&#8221; says Mr. Marsden, &#8220;I was called
on to visit a young woman, about twenty years of age,
in one of our districts, who was extremely ill, and who
wished very much to see me before she died. On my
arrival at her father&#8217;s house, I found her heavily
afflicted, and death appeared to be at no great distance.
I sat by her bedside with the Bible in my hand; expecting
to find her, as I have but too often found
others in similar circumstances, ignorant of the first
principles of religion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I read a portion of this sacred book to her, and was
most agreeably surprised to find that she not only understood
the letter but the spirit of the Scriptures.</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked her father how she became so well acquainted
with the Scriptures: he said he did not know&mdash;she
was always reading her Bible at every opportunity,
and sometimes sat up whole nights for that purpose.
He observed, she was a very dutiful daughter: he had
a large family, and she, being the eldest, and very
industrious, was of great service to her mother and
the younger branches of the family; the only indulgence
which she desired was to be allowed to read the
Bible when her work was done; but he could not
account for her attachment to it; and it seemed very
strange to him that she should attend to it so much.
I asked him if she was in the habit of going to church,
as I did not personally know her. He said she went
sometimes, but was generally prevented, from the distance
and the large family which she had to attend to.</p>

<p>&#8220;This young woman may be said to have obtained
her religion wholly from the Bible. None of the
family knew anything of the Bible but herself. I<span class="pagenum">[Pg 160]</span>
visited her during the whole of her sickness, from the
time she sent for me, until she fell asleep in Jesus.
Her faith was simple, her views of the way of salvation
clear. She gave me many proofs of this, in the various
conversations which I had with her during her sickness.
The Bible was more precious to her than gold;
she had found it, under the influence of the Divine
Spirit, her counsellor and her guide, and by it she had
been brought to a knowledge of the only true God,
and Jesus Christ whom he had sent; and hereby she
was filled with a hope full of immortality. Previously
to her last sickness, she had enjoyed good health: it
was in the prime of youth and vigour that she had
read her Bible, and loved it, so that she had not to
seek God, for the first time, in this trying moment;
but found him a present help in sickness and in the
approach of death. The Bible had testified of Christ
to her: she had found eternal life revealed therein;
and the Divine promises were both great and precious
to her soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such instances of faith, and of the happy effects of a
simple reliance upon the atonement, were at that time
of rare occurrence in the colony. Instances of conversion
simply from the reading of the Scriptures are
not perhaps so rare as we generally suppose. Lieutenant
Sadleir, who himself resided at Paramatta, has
remarked upon this occurrence: &#8220;It is gratifying to
the reflecting mind to observe such glimmerings of
light in the midst of so much darkness. Although
found in obscurity and in the cottage of the peasant,
it proved that there were some who had not bowed the
knee to the Baal of universal licentiousness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Marsden&#8217;s anxiety for the female convicts was
not to be abated by ridicule or opposition. We find<span class="pagenum">[Pg 161]</span>
him, in August, 1822, addressing a letter to Dr.
Douglas, the police magistrate of Paramatta, on their
behalf. Some of the sentiments are beautifully touching.
The substance of the plea on their behalf is
&#8220;that these poor creatures, who are confined in the
penitentiary, and who have committed no offence in
these settlements, be allowed the privilege of attending
at least once on the sabbath day on public worship.&#8221;
The request was surely reasonable, and in urging it
he rises to a pathetic eloquence: &#8220;There is no nation
under the heavens in whose bosom the wretched and
unfortunate finds so warm a reception as in our own.
The unhappy situation of the female convicts during
their confinement in the different jails in the empire
interests the best feelings of the human heart. They
are instructed by the counsels of the wise, consoled by
the prayers of the pious, softened by the tears of the
compassionate, and relieved by the alms of the benevolent.
The noble senator does not pass over their
crimes and their punishments unnoticed; he is anxious
for the prevention of the former, and the mitigation
of the latter; nor does the wise politician consider
them beneath his care.&#8221; He then speaks with natural
exultation of &#8220;the watchful eye with which the
British government provides for their wants and conveniences
during their voyage to New South Wales,
even more liberally than for the brave soldiers and
sailors who have fought the battles of their country,
and never violated its laws;&#8221; and then follows a sentence
which leaves us uncertain whether more to
admire his patriotism or the gentleness of his nature
and the warmth of his heart:</p>

<p>&#8220;This apparently singular conduct may seem as if
the British government wished to encourage crime<span class="pagenum">[Pg 162]</span>
and afterwards reward it; but upon a nearer view this
principle of action will be found to spring spontaneously
from virtue, from that inherent, laudable,
Christian compassion and anxiety, which the father of
the prodigal felt for his lost son, which kept alive the
spark of hope that he might one day return to his
father&#8217;s house and be happy. This parable of our
blessed Saviour&#8217;s most beautifully exhibits the character
of the British nation towards her prodigal sons
and daughters, and is more honourable to her than all
the victories she has achieved by sea and land.&#8221;</p>

<p>The welfare of the female convict population lay
near to Mr. Marsden&#8217;s heart; scarcely his beloved New
Zealanders and their missions engaged more of his affection.
His plans for the improvement of their temporal
condition, and his incessant labours for their
spiritual welfare, occupied no small portion of his time
and thoughts; and there is good reason to believe that
his labours amongst these outcasts were not &#8220;in vain
in the Lord.&#8221; Standing, as we should have thought,
himself in need of encouragement, he stimulated the
languid zeal of others. Mrs. Fry and other philanthropists
were now engaged in their great work of
amending our prison discipline at home. We have
inserted a letter from that excellent lady to Mr.
Marsden. His answer to it must have cheered her
spirits amidst the many disheartening toils to which
she was exposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Wellington had just arrived when,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;I went on board, and was highly gratified with the
order which appears to have been maintained in that
vessel. I could not have conceived that any ship could
have been fitted up to have afforded such accommodation
to the unfortunate female exiles as the Wel<span class="pagenum">[Pg 163]</span>lington
was. All the women looked clean, healthy,
and well. They had not that low, vicious, squalid,
dirty look which the women at former periods have had
when they first arrived. I believe there has been very
great attention paid by the master and surgeon to
their morals and comfort, in every possible way. The
very sight of the arrangements of the vessel showed
that the humane and benevolent wishes of the
Christian world had been carried into effect, and
proved beyond all contradiction that order and morality
can be maintained upon so long a voyage in a
female convict ship.... The present inquiry
into the state of this colony, before the committee of
the House of Commons, will greatly benefit this
country. I can speak from painful experience that
for the last twenty-six years, it has been the most
immoral, wretched society in all the Christian world.
Those who are intimate with the miseries and vices of
large jails alone can form any idea of the colony of
New South Wales. I know what Newgate was when
I was in London, in the years 1808 and 1809. I was
then in the habit of seeing that miserable abode of
vice and woe. What has since been done in Newgate
may be done elsewhere, if suitable means are adopted
by those in authority, seconded by individual exertions;
much might be done in these colonies towards restoring
the poor exiles to society, with the countenance and
support of the government. Great evils are not
removed without great difficulties. When I visited
the Wellington, I saw much had been done in
England, and more than I could have credited, had I
not been an eye witness of the situation of the
females.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Brisbane, the new governor, was not<span class="pagenum">[Pg 164]</span>
slow to perceive the worth of services such as those
which Mr. Marsden had rendered to the colony, and
pressed him to accept once more the office of a magistrate.
In reference to this, &#8220;I wish,&#8221; says Mr. Marsden,
in a letter to Dr. Mason Good, &#8220;to avoid the
office if I can; but I fear it will not be in my power,
without giving offence. The judges as well as the
public and the magistrates have urged me to take the
bench at the present time.&#8221; In the same letter, he
adds: &#8220;I feel happy that I have stood firm against all
calumnies and reproaches, and have been the instrument
of bringing to light the abominations that have been
committed here: and some of the evils are already
remedied.&#8221; The friends of religion and virtue in England
could not fail to sympathize with him, being well
assured that substantially he was fighting the cause of
true piety and equal justice, against profligacy and
oppression. Mr. Wilberforce wrote to him in the
year 1823, with his usual warm affection:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Though I may be a somewhat doubtful and unfrequent
correspondent, I am not an uncertain friend;
and where good will, as in your instance, is grounded
on early esteem, and cemented by the consciousness of
having many mutual friends, I should be ashamed if that
should suffer any decay from the impression not being
often renewed. It was with no small concern that I
heard that anything unpleasant had occurred. I had
meant to endeavour to obtain a sight of any letters or
papers to our common friends, and to have consulted
with them whether any, and if any, what measures,
could be taken for the benefit of your colony, or in
your own support, which, without a compliment, I
hold to be in a degree coincident.... And now, my
dear sir, farewell: but I ought not to conclude without<span class="pagenum">[Pg 165]</span>
congratulating you on the progressive advancement,
as I trust, of the religious and moral interests of your
Australian world, and begging that you will always
inform me unreservedly whenever you conceive I can
be of use publicly, or to yourself personally.</p>

<p class="quotsig">&#8220;I remain, with much esteem and regard,<br />
&#8220;My dear sir,<br />

&#8220;Your sincere friend,<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">W. Wilberforce</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The report of Commissioner Bigge was made public
soon afterwards; and with it the clouds which had
gathered so long around the chaplain of Paramatta
were at last dispersed. He was too prominent a mark
not to be again assailed. Always in the front of the
battle when the oppressed required protection, or evil
doers in high positions his bold assaults, it was not in
the nature of things that he should lead a very quiet life.
His calling was peculiar; so were his talents; and the
latter were admirably fitted for the former. But for
the present his triumph was complete, and the government
at home appreciated his faithful service. The
document which follows requires no further comment.
It was not received till some time had elapsed, but we
insert it here as a fitting conclusion to the chapter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Private Secretary&#8217;s Office, Sydney, 9th April, 1825.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Reverend Sir</span>,&mdash;I have the honour to acquaint
you, by command of his excellency the governor, that
Earl Bathurst, having taken into consideration your
long and useful services in the colony of New South
Wales, has determined upon increasing your stipend

annum.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have further the pleasing satisfaction of coupling
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 166]</span>with it his lordship&#8217;s instructions to the governor, to
acquaint you that it has been done in consideration of
your long, laborious, and praiseworthy exertions in

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<blockquote><p>Fourth Visit to New Zealand&mdash;Trials and Successes of the various
Missions&mdash;Shipwreck and Danger of Mr. Marsden and the Rev. S.
Leigh&mdash;Returns home&mdash;Letter to Avison Terry, Esq.</p></blockquote>

<p>In July, 1823, we find Mr. Marsden again taking ship
and embarking for New Zealand; his intention being
to visit the stations of the Church Missionary Society,
and to arrange its affairs. Since his last visit fresh
causes for anxiety had appeared. In consequence of
Shunghie&#8217;s misconduct, the natives were now alienated
from the missionaries; they had become indifferent to
education and agricultural improvements; and the
gospel, it was too evident, had made little progress
hitherto. Shunghie declared that as to himself, &#8220;he
wanted his children to learn to fight and not to read.&#8221;
The Maories about the settlement insisted upon being
paid for their services in fire-arms and ammunition.
&#8220;Since Shunghie&#8217;s return,&#8221; writes one of the missionaries,
&#8220;the natives, one and all, have treated us with
contempt. They are almost past bearing; coming into
our houses when they please, demanding food, thieving
whatever they can lay their hands on, breaking down
our garden fences, stripping the ship&#8217;s boats of everything
they can. They seem, in fact, ripe for any mischief;
had Mr. Marsden himself been amongst us,
much as he deserves their esteem, I believe he would
not escape without insult; but the Lord is a very
present help in time of trouble.&#8221; Amongst the missionaries
themselves certain evils had appeared, the
growth of a secular and commercial spirit, which had<span class="pagenum">[Pg 168]</span>
injured their cause, and threatened to frustrate the
great end for which the mission was projected. Mr.
Marsden heard of these untoward events, and hastened
his departure, full of anxiety, but not abating one
jot of his confidence in the final triumph of God&#8217;s
cause. What his feelings were his own journal testifies:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I am still confident that this land of darkness and
superstition will be visited by the day-star from on
high. The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all
flesh shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord
has spoken it. O Lord, let thy kingdom come; thy
will be done on earth as it is done in heaven. I have
suffered so much annoyance and persecution for some
time past, from unreasonable and wicked men, that I
am happy in leaving the colony for a little time, in
which I have experienced so much annoyance. In
reflecting upon the state of New Zealand there are
many things which give me both pleasure and pain. I
am happy the Church Missionary Society has not
relinquished the cause, but have sent out more strength
to carry on the work. Many have been the discouragements
from the misconduct of some of the servants of
the Society; but I am confident that the sword of the
Spirit, which is the word of God, will in time subdue
the hearts of these poor people to the obedience of
faith.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>He was accompanied on his voyage by the Reverend
Henry Williams and his family, who now went out to
strengthen the New Zealand mission, of which he
soon became one of the most effective leaders. One
of Bishop Selwyn&#8217;s first steps when he was appointed
bishop of New Zealand, was to make Mr. Henry
Williams one of his archdeacons, and since then he has<span class="pagenum">[Pg 169]</span>
been designated to a New Zealand bishopric in a
district inhabited exclusively by Christianized Maories.
Could Mr. Marsden have foreseen the course which
awaited his companion, how would his soul have
been cheered! but it was for him to sow in tears,
and for others to reap in joy. The field was not
yet ripe for the harvest; other men laboured, who
now sleep in the dust, and we of this generation
have entered into their labours. Mr. Marsden
was not mistaken in his estimate of his new companion.
Indeed he appears to have been very
seldom mistaken in the judgments he formed about
other men. &#8220;I think,&#8221; he notes, &#8220;that Mr. Williams
and his family will prove a great blessing to the
Society. I hope he will be able to correct and remedy,
in time, many evils that have existed, and also to set
an example to the rest what they as missionaries
should do.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was his fourth visit to New Zealand, and
though in some respects it was painful, yet in others
there was ground for joy. The cloud which the
prophet saw from Carmel, though no greater than a
man&#8217;s hand, foretold abundance of rain; and so now
too, at length, after nine years&#8217; toil, a few hopeful
symptoms appeared amongst the Maories. Their
anxious visitor observed with much pleasure, he says,
that since his last visit, the natives in general were
much improved in their appearance and manners; and
now for the first time he heard them, with strange
delight, sing some hymns and repeat some prayers in
their own language. This convinced him that, notwithstanding
the misconduct of a few of the Europeans,
the work was gradually going on, and the way
preparing for the blessings of the gospel. &#8220;I have no<span class="pagenum">[Pg 170]</span>
doubt that the greatest difficulties are now over, and
that God will either incline the hearts of those who
are now in New Zealand, to devote themselves to
their work, or he will find other instruments to do his
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet he had a painful duty to discharge. Firm as
he was and lion-hearted when danger was to be met,
his nature was very gentle, and his affections both
deep and warm; and he had now to rebuke some of the
missionaries whom he loved as his own soul, and even
to dismiss one of them. Of those whom he had been
obliged to censure, he writes thus:&mdash;&#8220;They expressed
their regret for the past, and a determination to act
in a different way for the future. Some, I have no
doubt, will retrace their steps, and will be more
cautious and circumspect, but I have not the same
confidence in all. Some express sorrow, but I fear
not that which worketh repentance.&#8221; Again he
remarks: &#8220;Missionary work is very hard work, unless
the heart is fully engaged in it. No consideration can
induce a man to do habitually what he has a habitual
aversion to. The sooner such a one leaves the work,
the better it will be for himself and the mission.&#8221;
But though compelled to blame, he did not forget to
sympathize. &#8220;The present missionaries, though some
of them have erred greatly from the right way, yet
have all had their trials and troubles. Some allowance
must be made for their peculiar situation, and their
want of Christian society, and of the public ordinances
of religion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Several chiefs, among whom was Tooi, warmly took
up the cause of the missionary who had been dismissed.
The conversation which followed is a beautiful illustration
of the too much forgotten Scripture which tells<span class="pagenum">[Pg 171]</span>
us that &#8220;a soft answer turneth away wrath,&#8221; while at
the same time it presents an interesting view of the
Maori mind and character at this critical period of
their national history.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Tooi addressing me, said a missionary had informed
him that day that he was going to leave New Zealand,
and the chiefs wished to know whether this person
had been dismissed for selling muskets and powder to
the natives. To this I replied that Mr. &mdash;&mdash; was
directed by the gentlemen in England who had sent
him out as a missionary, not to sell muskets and
powder; that it was not the custom in England for
clergymen to sell muskets and powder; and that no
missionary could be allowed to sell them in New
Zealand. As several of the chiefs present had been at
Port Jackson, I observed that they knew that the
clergymen there did not sell muskets and powder.
They knew that I had not one musket in my house,
and that they had never seen any when they were
with me. They replied, they knew what I said was
true. I further added we did not interfere with the
government of New Zealand; they did what they
pleased, and the missionaries should be allowed to do
what they pleased. Tooi said that this was but just,
and observed, &#8216;We are at present in the same state as
the Otaheitans were some time back. The Otaheitans
wanted only muskets and powder, and would have
nothing else, and now, as they knew better, they
wanted none; and the New Zealanders would care
nothing about muskets when they knew better, which
they would in time.&#8217; All the chiefs acquiesced in the
observations Tooi made. I was happy to find their
minds were so enlarged, and that they had begun to
take such proper views of the subject. I said, Tooi&#8217;s<span class="pagenum">[Pg 172]</span>
remarks upon the conduct of the Otaheitans were
very just, and told them that the Queen Charlotte
brig, which had sailed from the bay the preceding
day, belonged to the young king Pomare; that the
Otaheitans had sent oil and various other articles to
Port Jackson, and that they had received in return,
tea, sugar, and flour, and clothing, as they wanted
these articles, and that the New Zealanders might in
time have a ship of their own to procure sperm oil,
spars, etc., which they might sell at Port Jackson, and
many of them were able to kill the whales, having been
employed on board the whalers. When they got a
vessel of their own, they would soon be equal to the
Otaheitans, and give over their cruel wars. They
expressed much pleasure at having a vessel of their
own. After some further explanation the chiefs were
satisfied that Mr. &mdash;&mdash; had violated our laws and
had brought all his distress upon himself.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The conduct of the natives confirmed the impression
which Mr. Marsden had previously formed, and which
their subsequent history down to the present day
entirely sustains, that they are a noble race of men,
of considerable mental capacity, of great perseverance
and enterprise, who never lose sight of an object upon
which they have once set their minds; powerful
reasoners upon any subject that has come within
their knowledge; possessed of a quick perception and
a natural sagacity, which enables them to form a just
acquaintance with human nature as it presents itself
before them. Who would not wish that they too
may form a happy exception to the rule which
seems in every land to condemn the native population
to waste away before the advances of European
enterprise? Who would not desire that the Maorie<span class="pagenum">[Pg 173]</span>
tribes may long be a great and powerful nation,
protected, but not oppressed by English rule?</p>

<p>Mr. Marsden now paid a visit at Wangaroa, to the
Wesleyan missionary station there. Over the Wesleyan
missions he had of course no control or oversight,
such as that with which he was intrusted towards
the missions of the London Missionary Society
in the South Sea Islands. This, however, did not prevent
his taking an affectionate interest in their affairs.
He found Mr. Leigh, the founder of their mission, very
ill, and invited him to return with him on a voyage of
health and recreation to Port Jackson; and having taken
leave of the Church Missionary brethren with solemn
and affectionate counsels he embarked on the 6th of
September, 1823, with feelings which he thus describes.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I now felt much pleasure in the prospect of a
speedy return to my family and people, and being very
weary with various toils and anxieties both of body
and mind, I longed for a little rest, and retired to my
cabin with much thankfulness and comfort. I had
cause to be thankful for continual good health during
the period I had been in New Zealand, as I had
not lost one day. I felt great confidence in the Rev.
Mr. Williams, and I doubt not that God will prosper
the work, and raise up a seed in this benighted land to
serve him; for many shall come from the south as well
as the north, and shall sit down with Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob in the kingdom of God.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>But his bright visions were overcast. Like the
first and greatest of Christian missionaries, it was
ordained that he, too, &#8220;should suffer shipwreck and
be cast upon a desert island.&#8221; His own journal gives
us the story of his danger and deliverance.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 174]</span>&#8220;<i>Sunday 7th.</i>&mdash;This morning we weighed anchor. I
spent some time this day reading the Scriptures with
the Rev. S. Leigh, our subject for contemplation was the
1st chapter of St. Paul to the Romans. The weather was
very threatening and stormy; the wind from the eastward
and strong, blowing directly into the mouth of the harbour.
We lay in Korororika Bay, on the south side of
the harbour, and had to sail along a lee rocky shore.
In working out with the wind dead on the land, the
ship being light and high out of the water she would
not answer her helm, and twice missed stays. The
lead was kept continually sounding, and we soon found
ourselves in little more than three fathoms water,
with a rocky bottom and a shoal of rocks on our lee,
and it was then high water. When the captain found
the situation we were in, he immediately ordered to
let go the anchor, which was done. When the tide
turned the ship struck, the gale increased, and the sea
with it; a shipwreck was now more than probable;
there appeared no possible way to prevent it. The
Rev. Mr. Leigh was very ill, and felt the disturbance
much, Mrs. Leigh also being very ill. I requested the
captain to lend me the boat to take Mr. and Mrs.
Leigh to the nearest island, where we arrived very
safely, the island being but two miles distant. The
natives expressed much concern for us, made a fire,
prepared the best hut they could, which was made of
bulrushes, for our reception. I requested them to send
a canoe to Rungheehe, to inform Mr. and Mrs. Hall of
the loss of the ship, and to bring their boat to assist in
bringing the people to land. At the same time, I
desired they would tell the natives to bring a large
war canoe. The natives for some time alleged that
their canoe would be dashed to pieces by the waves,
but at length I prevailed upon them. They had<span class="pagenum">[Pg 175]</span>
between five and six miles to go, through a very rough
sea. About three o&#8217;clock, Messrs. Hall, King, and
Hanson, arrived in Mr. Hall&#8217;s boat, and a large war
canoe with natives; they immediately proceeded to
the ship, and we had the satisfaction to see them
arrive safe, and waited until dark with the greatest
anxiety for their return. The rain fell in torrents, the
gale increased, and they had not returned; we lay
down in our little hut full of fear for the safety of all
on board. The night appeared very long, dark, and
dreary. As we could not rest, we most anxiously wished
for the morning light, to learn some account of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>September 8th.</i>&mdash;When the day arrived we had
the happiness to see the vessel still upright, but
driven nearer the shore. No boat or canoe from her;
the gale still increased; about mid-day we saw the
mainmast go overboard. The natives on the island
screamed aloud when the mast fell. I concluded they
had cut away the mast to relieve the vessel. We
spent the rest of this day in great suspense, as we
could not conjecture why all the passengers should
remain on board in the state the ship was in. At dark
in the evening Mr. Hall returned, and informed us
that the bottom of the vessel was beaten out, and that
both her chain and best bower cable were parted; and
that she beat with such violence upon the rocks when
the tide was in that it was impossible to stand upon
the deck; at the same time, he said, there was no
danger of any lives being lost, as he did not think the
vessel would go to pieces, as she stood firm upon the
rock, when the tide was out. He said, the passengers
on board had not determined what they would
do, or where they would land as yet; they wished to
wait till the gale was abated. Mr. Hall&#8217;s information<span class="pagenum">[Pg 176]</span>
relieved us much; as it was now dark, the wind high,
and the sea rough, we could not leave the island, and
therefore took up our lodgings in our little hut.</p>

<p>&#8220;The natives supplied us with a few potatoes and
some fish. My pleasing prospect of returning to Port
Jackson was at an end, for some time at least. I was
exceedingly concerned for the loss of so fine a vessel
on many accounts, as individuals who are interested in
her must suffer as well as the passengers on board,
and spent the night in reflections on the difficulties
with which I was surrounded; while the raging of
the storm continued without intermission.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Tuesday 9th.</i>&mdash;At the return of day we discovered
the ship still upright, but she appeared to be higher
on the reef. I now determined to return to Kiddee-Kiddee
in Mr. Hall&#8217;s boat with Mr. and Mrs. Leigh.
We left the island for the missionary settlement,
where we arrived about nine o&#8217;clock. Our friends had
not heard of the loss of the ship until our arrival, as
there had not been any communication between the
different settlements in consequence of the severe
weather. We were very kindly received by the
brethren; I informed them in what situation we had
left the ship, and requested that every assistance
might be given to land the passengers and luggage.
The wreck was about twelve or fourteen miles from
the settlement. Four boats were immediately sent off;
Mr. Hall&#8217;s boat took the women and children to
Rungheehe, and two of the boats returned with part of
our luggage, and we went to the station of the Rev.
Henry Williams. All the brethren rendered every
aid in their power. The boats on their return brought
the welcome news that all was well on board, and Mr.
Leigh did not appear to have suffered much injury<span class="pagenum">[Pg 177]</span>
from the wet and cold he endured on the island, though
in so weak a state. Divine wisdom has no doubt some
wise ends to answer in all that has befallen us. The
word of God expressly says all things shall work
together for the good of them that love God, and the
Scripture cannot be broken.</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot see through this dark and mysterious
dispensation at the present time; the why and wherefore
we must leave to him who ordereth all things
according to the counsel of his own will. As the gale
continued with unremitting violence, if we had gone
out to sea we might have been cast on shore under
more dangerous and distressing circumstances. Our
shipwreck has been a most merciful one, as no lives
have been lost, nor anything but the ship.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The shipwreck of the Brampton&mdash;for that was
the vessel&#8217;s name&mdash;occurred on the 7th of September,
and in consequence Mr. Marsden was detained in New
Zealand until the 14th of November, when he returned
home in the Dragon, and arrived at Sydney in the
beginning of December, 1823. The interval was not
lost; for he seems to have been one of those who
gather up the fragments of time, and turn to the best
account the idle hours and spare moments of life. He
drew up some excellent rules for the guidance of the
missionaries and Christian settlers in their intercourse
with the shipping which now began to visit the Bay
of Islands. He encouraged the erection of a school-house
for the natives. &#8220;The foundation,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;must be laid in the education of the rising generation.
The children possess strong minds, are well-behaved
and teachable. They are capable of learning anything
we wish to teach them.&#8221; During his detention
he also addressed a circular letter to the missionaries<span class="pagenum">[Pg 178]</span>
respecting a grammar in the Maori or New Zealand
language, pointing out the necessity of adopting some
more systematic method both for its arrangement and
pronunciation. This led to a new vocabulary of the
native language, and in a short time to a new method
of spelling. We have, of course, retained Mr. Marsden&#8217;s
orthography of New Zealand names, but we may
remark, by the way, it is very different from that
which has been since introduced. Shunghie became
E&#8217;Hongi; Kiddee Kiddee, Keri Keri; and so in other
instances. But even Mr. Marsden, with all his
sagacity, did not penetrate New Zealand&#8217;s future, nor
foresee in how short a time the well-known and
familiar sounds of English towns and villages would
be transferred to that still savage island, superseding
even in Maori lips their native designations. It seems
probable that the New Zealand language may, in the
course of another generation, come to be known only
by the grammar which the missionaries compiled and
the Scriptures which they have since translated. But
whatever be its fate, it is in a high degree sonorous and
expressive, and had it but an antique literature, a
Tallessin or an Ossian, it could never perish. Without
a literature of its own no spoken language can long
endure against the assaults of that which is evidently
destined to be the universal speech of trade and
commerce, the English tongue. On the other hand
the literature of a language, or even of a dialect,
embalms it after it has ceased to be a spoken tongue
even to the end of time.</p>

<p>And lastly, a political object occupied some of Mr.
Marsden&#8217;s time and thoughts. The incessant and
desolating wars which the native tribes waged against
each other were, he saw, the great obstacle to the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 179]</span>
progress of New Zealand. The missions were always
insecure, for the country was always more or less
disturbed. Civil war is, under all circumstances, the
bane, and, if persisted in, the ruin of a country; add
the ferocity of New Zealand warfare, its cannibalism
and its undying spirit of revenge, and nothing more
was wanted to degrade the finest country under heaven
into a very pit of darkness. All this Mr. Marsden
felt; he conceived that if he could succeed in establishing
some one chief as supreme, a plan of government
might be drawn up securing life and property throughout
the island. He consulted Shunghie, Wyatto
Riva, and other powerful chieftains. Shunghie&#8217;s
ambitious spirit would have embraced the proposal,
the condition being, of course, that he should be the
sovereign; but the jealousy of the rest prevented
anything like unanimity. Riva justly remarked that
to have any superior would degrade them; yet all the
chiefs appeared tired of war and the unsettled state
consequent upon it. So the project failed.</p>

<p>At length he returned home, accompanied by six
New Zealand youths, whose eagerness was such that
they gladly promised to sleep upon the deck rather
than miss the opportunity. Mr. Leigh, the Wesleyan
missionary, was also his fellow voyager. Mr. Leigh&#8217;s
opinion of Mr. Marsden and his labours is highly
gratifying, and not the less so as coming from one
who belonged to another Society. &#8220;The shipwreck,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;which we have experienced will, I have no
doubt, prove favourable to the reputation of the New
Zealanders. For several days we were in their power,
and they might have taken all that we had with the
greatest ease; but instead of oppressing and robbing
us, they actually sympathized with us in our trials and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 180]</span>
afflictions. Mr. Marsden, myself, and Mrs. Leigh,
were at a native village for several days and nights,
without any food but what the natives brought us;
what they had they gave us willingly, and said&mdash;&#8216;Poor
creatures! you have nothing to eat, and you are not
accustomed to our kind of food.&#8217; I shall never forget
the sympathy and kindness of these poor heathens.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I do hope that the Rev. S. Marsden will be successful
in his endeavours to put an end to the frequent
wars in New Zealand. I have heard many natives
and chiefs say, &#8216;It is no good to go to fight and eat
men; we wish to cease from war, and retire to some
peaceful place.&#8217; I pray God that this object may
be soon effected among this people. The Christian
world, and especially the Church Missionary Society,
will never be able fully to appreciate the valuable
labours of the Rev. Samuel Marsden. His fervent
zeal, his abundant toil, and extensive charity in the
cause of missions, are beyond estimation. May he
live long as a burning and shining light in the missionary
world!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Within a few days of his return home, Mr. Marsden,
the impression of his visit still fresh upon his mind,
wrote the following interesting letter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Paramatta, December 20, 1823.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My very dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I now sit down to thank you
for your very valuable presents, which you were so kind
as to send me for the natives of New Zealand. They
arrived a little before I sailed for that island. I was
at Van Diemen&#8217;s Land when the vessel which brought
them arrived at Port Jackson. On my return from
the southern settlements I prepared for New Zealand.
Your spades, axes, etc., made the hearts of many
rejoice; and they are now dispersed over the country,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 181]</span>from the North Cape to the Thames. When I arrived
at the Bay of Islands there were several chiefs there,
who had fled for safety in the late wars, but returned
when peace was restored, and took with them some of
your presents. I have just returned from New Zealand,
having been absent about twenty weeks; was
shipwrecked, but no lives were lost. The natives have
made considerable advances in civilization, and I have
no doubt they will become a great nation in due
time. Much has been done already to better their
situation. I believe their agriculture has increased
more than twenty-fold since they have got hoes, but it
will be many years before every man in the island will
be able to procure a hoe. The Church Missionary
Society has done much for them, and their labour has
not been in vain. All that is wanted now is faithful
missionaries to labour amongst them; it will be very
difficult to find such men. There are even very few
pious men who are qualified to be missionaries; it
requires much self-denial, much patience, and much
perseverance, united with the wisdom of the serpent
and the innocence of the dove. Men, also, of education
and knowledge are wanted; ignorant men, though
possessed of piety, will be found ill-qualified for a
mission in New Zealand. The natives are a wise and
understanding people, and will pry into the very secrets
of every man who resides amongst them. Their
study is human nature in all its bearings; they talk
more of the heart of man than we do, and of the evil
that is lodged there. They will soon find out a man&#8217;s
real character, whether he is ignorant or wise, prudent
or foolish, and will estimate the benefits which they are
likely to derive from his knowledge, his good temper,
his charity, and will esteem him or despise him accord<span class="pagenum">[Pg 182]</span>ingly.
A wise and prudent man will have great influence
over them, while they would laugh at an
ignorant man. A good farmer or mechanic would be
much esteemed, because they would be benefited by
him. I have gained considerable knowledge of their
customs and manners in my last visit. Cannibalism
is interwoven through the whole of their religious
system. They offer up human sacrifices as sin offerings.
Whenever the gospel shall be revealed to them
they will very easily understand the doctrine of the
atonement. They demand a sacrifice or an atonement
for almost everything which they consider as an
injury. Human sacrifices are offered for the death of
their friends, whether they are slain in battle or die a
natural death. Their eating human flesh has its origin
in superstition. They pay great attention to all the
ceremonies of their religion, and are very much afraid
of offending their god. As for their wars, these will
not be prevented until an object can be found that
will employ their active minds. Agriculture and
commerce are the only means that promise to remedy
their civil wars; when these can be brought into
operation they will have a beneficial effect. It is only
the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, that
can subdue their hearts to the obedience of faith. I
am of opinion that civilization and Christianity will go
hand in hand, if means are used at the same time to
introduce both, and one will aid and assist the other.
To bring this noble race of human beings to the
knowledge of the only true God and Jesus Christ is
an attempt worthy of the Christian world. I believe
as God has stirred up the hearts of his people to pray
for them, and to open both their hearts and their
purses he will prosper the work, and raise up a people
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 183]</span>from amongst these savages to call him blessed. In
time the voice of joy and gladness will be heard in the
present abodes of cruelty, darkness, and superstition.
I consider every axe, every hoe, every spade, in New
Zealand as an instrument to prepare the way of the
Lord. They are silent but sure missionaries in the
hands of the natives of that country. I was very
happy to learn that your dear mother was still alive,
and all your family were well at present. Remember
us kindly to your mother, if still alive, and to
Mrs. Terry and our other friends.</p>

<p class="quotsig">&#8220;I am, yours affectionately,<br />

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<blockquote><p>Aborigines&mdash;South Sea Mission&mdash;Fresh Slanders on Mr. Marsden&#8217;s
character&mdash;His Pamphlet in self-defence&mdash;Letter of Messrs. Bennett
and Tyerman&mdash;Libels and Action at Law&mdash;Verdict&mdash;Case of Ring&mdash;Pastoral
Letters of Mr. Marsden: To a Lady; On the Divinity of
Christ&mdash;Fifth Voyage to New Zealand&mdash;Letters, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>Scarcely had Mr. Marsden returned to Paramatta
when we find him in correspondence with the new
governor on the subject of the aborigines of Australia.
They were already wasting away in the presence of
the European colonists like snow before the sun.
Their restless and wandering habits seemed to present
insuperable difficulties, whether the object were to
convert or merely to protect them. His memorandum
to the governor, and subsequent correspondence
with the Church Missionary Society, show his anxiety
for their welfare and the largeness of his heart. Each
new project, as it came before him, was welcomed
with serious attention, while at the same time there
was no fickleness, no relaxation of his efforts in his
old engagements and pursuits. But he was not
allowed to connect his name with the evangelization
of these poor heathen. Various attempts have been
made by different denominations to bring them into
the fold of Christ, but hitherto with very small success.
It seems, at length, as if Christians had acquiesced
in the conclusion that their conversion is
hopeless, that we can do nothing more than to throw
over them the shield of the British government, and
prevent their wholesale destruction by lawless &#8220;squatters&#8221;
and &#8220;bush-rangers.&#8221; We shall return, however,
to the subject hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 185]</span>His interest in the mission to the South Sea Islands
continued unabated. The London Missionary Society
had deputed the Rev. Daniel Tyerman and George
Bennett, Esq., to visit these missions, and bring home
in person a report of all they might see upon the
spot. On their voyage, they stayed awhile at Sydney,
and Mr. Marsden addressed a letter to them, which
shows his own zeal in the cause, and the painful
apathy or profane contempt of others. Such memorials,
in this day of comparative fervour, ought not to
be forgotten. When a Livingstone returns home to
receive a shower of honours from a grateful country
let us not forget the venerable pioneers in the same
missionary work, and the different treatment they
experienced. The contrast will call forth emotions
both of gratitude and of shame.</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Sydney, November 4, 1824.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;I know of no circumstance that
has given me more satisfaction than your mission to
the South Sea Islands. The attempt to introduce the
arts of civilization and the knowledge of Christianity
amongst the inhabitants of those islands was confessedly
great. An undertaking of such a new and
important nature could not be accomplished without
much labour, expense, anxiety, and risk, to all who
were concerned in the work. The missionaries, for
the first ten years, suffered every privation in the
islands, from causes which I need not state. They
called for every support and encouragement to induce
them to remain in the islands, and to return to their
stations, after they had been compelled to take refuge
in New South Wales. During these ten years, I used
every means in my power to assist the missionaries,
and to serve the Society Islands. During the next
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 186]</span>ten years, the ruling powers in this colony manifested
a very hostile spirit to the mission. As I felt it my
pleasure as well as my duty to support the cause, I
fell under the marked displeasure of those in authority,
and had a painful warfare to maintain for so long a
period, and many sacrifices I had to make. The ungodly
world always treated the attempt to introduce
the gospel among the natives of the Islands as wild and
visionary, and the Christian world despaired of success.</p>

<p>&#8220;In those periods of doubt and uncertainty in the
public mind, I suffered much anxiety, as very great
responsibility was placed on me. Sometimes, from
one cause and another, my sleep departed from me;
though I was persuaded God would bless the work.
The work is now done; this your eyes have seen, and
your ears heard; in this I do rejoice and will rejoice.
I wish you, as representatives of the Society,
to satisfy yourselves, from friends and foes, relative to
my conduct towards the mission for the last twenty-five
years. You must be aware that many calumnies
have been heaped upon me, and many things laid to
my charge which I know not. My connexion with
the missionaries and the concerns of the mission has
been purely of a religious nature, without any secular
views or temporal interests; and my services, whether
they be great or small, were gratuitous. The missionaries,
as a body, are very valuable men, and as
such I love them; but some of them, to whom I had
been kind, have wounded me severely, both here and
elsewhere. I have always found it difficult to manage
religious men; what they state, though in a bad
spirit, is generally believed by the Christian world.
I need not enter into the circumstances which urged
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 187]</span>me to purchase the Queen Charlotte, as you are in
full possession of them; you are also acquainted with
the reason why her expenses became so heavy, the
fall of colonial produce more than twenty per cent. in
so short a period, which no one could have anticipated
at that time, and the increased duty of one hundred
per cent. upon tobacco. If these two circumstances
had not occurred, there would have been no loss to any
individuals or the mission. I inclose the statement
of the accounts of the Queen Charlotte, and shall
leave the matter in your hands, to act as you think
proper. I shall also leave the Society to make their
own account of the interest upon the 600l. I borrowed.
I have no doubt but the Society will be satisfied that I
had no motive but the good of the mission, and that, as
Christian men who fear God, they will do what is just
and right. I shall therefore leave the matter in your
hands.</p>

<p class="quotsig">&#8220;I have the honour to be, gentlemen,<br />
&#8220;Your most obedient, humble servant,<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Samuel Marsden</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>While thus engaged, he was still a faithful minister
of the gospel in its richest consolations, and a bold
opponent of vice. His position as a magistrate not
only obliged him to reprove but to punish sin. The
task was difficult, when the real offender, in too many
cases, was not the wretched culprit at the bar of justice,
but some rich and insolent delinquent, beyond the
reach of the limited powers of a colonial magistrate.
In consequence of Mr. Marsden&#8217;s fearless conduct in a
case we shall not describe, he was at length formally
dismissed from the magistracy. All that is necessary
to be known, in order to vindicate his character, is
contained in an extract of a letter written by himself<span class="pagenum">[Pg 188]</span>
to Mr. Nicholson, dated Paramatta, 12th August,
1824:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;My very dear sir,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I have still to strive
against sin and immorality, which brings upon me the
hatred of some men in power; this I must expect from
those who live on in sin and wickedness.... You
would hear of the whole bench of magistrates at Paramatta
being dismissed at one stroke, five in number&mdash;Messrs.
... and your humble servant. We fell in
the cause of truth and virtue. If certain individuals
could have knocked me down, and spared my colleagues,
I should have fallen alone; but there was no alternative
but to sacrifice all at once. I glory in my disgrace. As
long as I live I hope to raise a standard against vice and
wickedness. We have some Herods here who would
take off the head of the man who dared to tell them
that adultery was a crime.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>He was still subject to the most annoying insults.
Imputations, ludicrous from their absurdity and violence,
were heaped upon him. In reading the libels
which were published in the colony, and in England
too, about this time, we should suppose that the man
against whom they were aimed was some delinquent,
notorious even in a penal settlement. He was openly
accused of being &#8220;a man of the most vindictive spirit,&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;a
turbulent and ambitious priest,&#8221;&mdash;a &#8220;cruel magistrate&#8221;&mdash;an
&#8220;avaricious man.&#8221; These charges,
amongst many more, were contained in a work in two
volumes octavo, professing to give an account of Australasia,
which reached a third edition, and to which
the author&#8217;s name was attached. As if these were not
sufficient to grind his reputation to the dust, further
charges of hypocrisy and bigotry were thrown in.
These last were easily repelled; to refute the others<span class="pagenum">[Pg 189]</span>
was more difficult, inasmuch as facts were involved
which it was necessary to clear up and place in a just
light before the public. It might have seemed magnanimous
to despise such assailants, and meet them
with silent pity. And yet we doubt whether such
magnanimity would have been wise, for with a
blemished reputation his usefulness would have been
at an end; since his accusers were not anonymous
hirelings, but magistrates and men of high position in
the colony.</p>

<p>He referred the matter to his friends at home,
placing his character in their hands. He was willing
to institute an action for libel, if this step were thought
advisable; or else to lay a statement of his wrongs
before the House of Commons; and he transmitted
the manuscript of a pamphlet, in self-justification, to
his friend Dr. Mason Good. It was accompanied with
a letter, remarkable for the modest estimate of his
own abilities, as well as for true Christian meekness:
&#8220;I have requested our mutual friend, Baron Field,
Esq., to show the documents to you, and to consult
with you on the propriety of publishing them. I have
much more confidence in your superior judgment than
in my own.... Many hard contests,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I
have had in this colony. But God has hitherto overruled
all for good, and he will continue to do so. As
a Christian I rejoice in having all manner of evil spoken
of me by wicked men. As a member of society, it is
my duty to support, by every lawful means, an upright
character. The good of society calls upon me
to do this, from the public situation I hold, as well as
that gospel which I believe; on this principle I think
it right to notice Mr. W.&#8217;s work. I leave it,&#8221; he adds,
&#8220;to you and my other friends to publish what I have<span class="pagenum">[Pg 190]</span>
written or not, as you may think proper, and with
what alterations and arrangements you may think
necessary. I do not know how to make a book, any
more than a watch, but you have learned the trade completely;
I therefore beg your assistance, for which I
shall feel very grateful.&#8221; But even these anxieties
could not engross his confidential correspondence. In
the same letter we have pleasant mention of New Zealand
and its missionaries:&mdash;&#8220;I have no doubt about
New Zealand; we must pray much for them, and labour
hard, and God will bless the labour of our hands.&#8221;
Nor is science quite forgotten:&mdash;&#8220;I have sent you a
small box of fossils and minerals, by Captain Dixon, of
the Ph&oelig;nix, from Point Dalrymple principally; the
whole of them came from Van Diemen&#8217;s Land.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Wilberforce and other friends of religion were
consulted; and under their advice his pamphlet was
published in London, though not till the year 1826.
It is entitled, &#8220;An Answer to certain Calumnies, etc.,
by the Rev. Samuel Marsden, principal Chaplain to
the colony of New South Wales.&#8221; It contains a
temperate, and at the same time a conclusive answer,
to all the charges made against him. To some of
these we have already had occasion to refer; others
have lost their interest. The charge of hypocrisy was
chiefly grounded on the fact that a windmill, on Mr.
Marsden&#8217;s property, had been seen at work on Sunday.
But &#8220;the mill,&#8221; he says, &#8220;was not in my possession
at that time, nor was I in New South Wales. I never
heard of the circumstance taking place but once; and
the commissioner of inquiry was the person who told
me of it after my return from New Zealand. I expressed
my regret to the commissioner that anything
should have taken place, in my absence, which had<span class="pagenum">[Pg 191]</span>
the appearance that I sanctioned the violation of the
sabbath-day. As I was twelve hundred miles off at the
time, it was out of my power to prevent what had happened;
but I assured him it should not happen again,
<i>for the mill should be taken down</i>, which was done.&#8221; How
few, it is to be feared, would make such a sacrifice,
simply to avoid the possibility of a return of the appearance
of evil! The charge of bigotry arose out of
his interference with Mr. Crook, a person in the colony
who had formerly been intended for the South Sea mission.
It was at the request of the missionaries themselves,
that Mr. Marsden, as agent of their Society,
had been led to interfere; but he was represented, in
consequence, as &#8220;a persecutor of dissenters.&#8221; Messrs.
Bennett and Tyerman were then in Australia; and in
answer to Mr. Marsden&#8217;s request that &#8220;they would
do him the favour to communicate to him their impartial
opinion, how far he had in any way merited
such an accusation, either as it respects Mr. C. or any
other missionary belonging to the London Missionary
Society,&#8221; he received a grateful acknowledgment of
his services, which we are happy to insert:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Sydney, May 11, 1825.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Rev. and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;We have to acknowledge
the receipt of your letter of the 5th inst., requesting
our opinion, as the representatives of the London
Missionary Society, on one of the malicious charges
against you in the outrageous publication lately come
to the colony. It is with the utmost satisfaction we
state, as our decided opinion, that the charge of intolerance
or persecution towards Mr. Crook, or any other
missionary connected with the London Society, or,
indeed, connected with any other missionary society,
is utterly untrue. We believe it to have originated
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 192]</span>in malice or culpable ignorance, and to be a gross
libel.</p>

<p>&#8220;We rejoice, sir, to take the opportunity to say
that the South Sea mission, and all its missionaries,
have been, and continue, to be, exceedingly indebted to
your singular kindness and persevering zeal in their
behalf. No temporal reward, we are persuaded, would
have been equivalent to the most valuable services
which you have so long and so faithfully rendered to
this mission and its missionaries. After all your upright
and perfectly disinterested kindness towards the
missionaries, when they have been residing on the
Islands,&mdash;when they have been residing in the colony,
on their way from England to the Islands,&mdash;when they
have voluntarily returned from the Islands to the
colony,&mdash;and when, from dire necessity and cruel persecution,
compelled to flee from the scenes of their missionary
labours, and take up their residence here; that
you have met with so much calumny, and so few returns
of grateful acknowledgment, for all you have done and
borne on their behalf, is to us a matter of surprise and
regret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Allow us, dear sir, to conclude by expressing our
hope, that the other envenomed shafts aimed at you
in this infamous publication, will prove as impotent as
that aimed at you through that Society, in whose
name, and as whose representatives, we beg to renew
its cordial thanks and unqualified acknowledgments.
And desiring to present our own thanks in the amplest

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 193]</span>The case of James Ring, we cannot pass unnoticed.
It shows the cruelty with which Mr.
Marsden&#8217;s reputation was assailed on the one hand,
and his own firm and resolute bearing on the other.
Ring was a convict, who for his general good conduct
had been assigned as a domestic servant to Mr.
Marsden. He was permitted by the latter, in accordance
with the usual custom, to work occasionally at
his own trade&mdash;that of a painter and glazier, on his
own account, and as a reward for his good conduct.
He was frequently employed in this way by the residents
at Paramatta; amongst others by the chief
magistrate himself. This man having been ill-treated
and severely beaten by another servant, applied, with
Mrs. Marsden&#8217;s approbation, to the magistrates of
Paramatta for redress; instead of receiving which, he
was charged by them with being illegally at large, and
committed to the common jail.</p>

<p>Mr. Marsden was then absent on duty in the
country: on appearing before the bench of magistrates
upon his return home, he at once stated that he had
given permission to Ring to work occasionally for
himself, and that therefore if there was any blame it
lay with him, and not the prisoner. The magistrates
not only ordered Mr. Marsden to be fined two shillings
and sixpence per day for each day his servant had been
thus at large, under the assumed plea of his transgressing
a general government order, but also ordered
Ring to be remanded to jail and ironed; and he was
subsequently worked in irons in a penal gang. &#8220;At
this conviction there was no informer, nor evidence,&#8221;
(we are now quoting Mr. Marsden&#8217;s words, from a
statement which he made before a court of inquiry
instituted by Lord Bathurst, the colonial minister at<span class="pagenum">[Pg 194]</span>
home, to investigate the subject at Mr. Marsden&#8217;s
request,) &#8220;but the bench convicted me on my own admission
that I had granted indulgence to my servant
to do jobs in the town. There were two convictions,
the first was on the 17th of May, 1823. On the 23rd
of the same month, without a hearing, or being
present, without informer, evidence, or notice, on the
same charge I was convicted in the penal sum of ten
pounds. On the 7th of June, a convict constable
entered my house with a warrant of execution, and
levied the fine by distress and sale of my property.&#8221;</p>

<p>These convictions took place under an obsolete
colonial regulation of 1802, made in the first instance
by Governor King, to meet a temporary emergency;
but virtually set aside by a general order of Governor
Macquarie&#8217;s, of a much later date, granting the
indulgence under certain regulations, with which Mr.
Marsden had complied. Mr. Marsden says, in his
official defence, that he &#8220;was the only person in the
colony who was ever fined under such circumstances,
since the first establishment of the colony, to the
present time.&#8221; And he adds a statement which, had it
not come down to us thus accredited under his own
hand, would have seemed incredible, namely that &#8220;the
two magistrates by whom the fines were inflicted,
Dr.&mdash;&mdash; and Lieut.&mdash;&mdash;, were doing, on that
very day, the same thing for which they fined me and
punished my servant, and I pointed that out to them
at the time they were sitting on the bench, and which
they could not deny.&#8221; Denial indeed was out of the
question, since, says Mr. Marsden, &#8220;one of Dr.&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s
convict servants, Henry Buckingham, by trade a
tailor, was working for me, and had been so for
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 195]</span>months. Lieut.&mdash;&mdash; at that very time also had
two convict servants belonging to Dr. Harris, working
for him at his own house.&#8221;</p>

<p>In vain did Mr. Marsden appeal to the governor;
even he was afraid to breast the torrent, which for a
time bore all before it. &#8220;He found no reason to
interfere with the colonial law.&#8221; Mr. Marsden
prayed him at least to bring the matter before a full
bench of magistrates, in whose hands he would leave
his character; this, too, the governor declined, whereupon
as a last step, he laid the affair before the
supreme court for its decision; prosecuting the
magistrates, and obtaining a verdict for the amount of
the fine so unjustly levied. They now affected to
triumph in the small amount of the damages in which
they were cast, &#8220;wishing,&#8221; he says, &#8220;to make
the world believe that the injury I had sustained was
proportionally small.&#8221; And thus even his forbearance
and his Christian spirit in rendering good for evil,
were turned against him; for he had instructed his
solicitor expressly, not to insert in the indictment the
count or charge of malice, but merely to sue for the
recovery of the amount of the fine. He states the
case thus in simple and forcible language. &#8220;I may
here observe, the only error it appears I committed
originally was in not prosecuting the magistrates
for vindictive damages before the supreme
court. Had I alleged malice, I must have obtained a
verdict accordingly; but I sought for no vindictive
damages; I sought redress no further than to set my
character right with the public. To have done more
than this would not have become me, according to my
judgment, as a minister of the gospel, and I instructed
my solicitor, Mr. Norton, merely to sue for the amount
of the award which had been levied on my property<span class="pagenum">[Pg 196]</span>
by warrant and distress of sale. The court gave me
the amount I prosecuted for, with costs of suit, and
with this I was perfectly satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>For two whole years this miserable affair lingered
on. The unfortunate man Ring at length gave way
to despondency, made his escape from the colony, and
found his way to New Zealand, but was never heard
of more. Mr. Marsden was much concerned for Ring&#8217;s
misfortunes, and deplored his rashness in making his
escape when all his sufferings were unmerited. &#8220;I
knew,&#8221; he says, &#8220;if he should return to England and
be apprehended as a returned felon, his life would be
forfeited.&#8221; Such even to a recent period was the
severity of our penal code, an escaped felon was
consigned to the gallows. With a view of preventing
this additional calamity, he wrote to the Right
Honourable Mr. Robert Peel, his Majesty&#8217;s secretary
of state for the home department, under date of July
1824; and having stated the case, he says: &#8220;I feel
exceedingly for Ring; should he return to England and
fall a sacrifice to the law, I should never forgive myself
unless I used every means in my power to save him.
The above statement of facts might have some influence
with the executive in saving his life, if the
circumstances of the case could reach the throne of
mercy.&#8221; The contents of this letter were transmitted
by Mr. Peel to Lord Bathurst the colonial secretary,
and his lordship ordered the governor of New South
Wales to establish a formal inquiry into the case.
A court was accordingly summoned at Sydney, consisting
of the governor assisted by two assessors,
the chief justice and the newly-appointed archdeacon
Scott, before which Mr. Marsden was cited to appear.
He did so, the whole affair was investigated, and the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 197]</span>
result was, as the reader will have anticipated, not
only Mr. Marsden&#8217;s entire acquittal of the charges
which wantonness and malice had preferred, but the
establishment of his reputation as a man of high
courage and pure integrity, and a Christian minister
of spotless character.</p>

<p>The Christian reader will probably ask what were
the effects of these various trials upon Mr. Marsden&#8217;s
mind and temper? Did he become selfish and
morose? were his spiritual affections quickened? As
a minister of Christ, did his light shine with a more
resplendent ray, or was it disturbed and overcast with
gloom? To suggest and answer such inquiries are
the proper uses of biography, especially the biography
of religious men. With regard, then, to his habitual
temper and tone of mind nothing can be more cheering
than a letter, which we now insert, written to a
lady in solitude, when the storm of insult and misrepresentation
was at its highest pitch.</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Paramatta, December 26, 1824.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Dear Mrs. F.</span>,&mdash;I received your kind letter by Mr.
Franklane, and was happy to learn that you and your
little boy were well. The circumstance to which you
allude is not worthy to be had in recollection for a
single moment, and I hope you will blot it out of your
remembrance for ever; we are so weak and foolish, and
I may add sinful, that we allow real or imaginary trifles
to vex and tease our minds, while subjects of eternal
moment make little impression upon us. It is a
matter of no moment to our great adversary, if he can
only divert our minds from attending to the best
things. He wishes at all times &#8216;a root of bitterness&#8217;
should &#8216;spring up&#8217; in our minds, as this will eat like
a canker every pious feeling, every Christian disposi<span class="pagenum">[Pg 198]</span>tion.
&#8216;Learn of me,&#8217; says our blessed Lord, &#8216;for I am
meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto
your souls.&#8217; &#8216;The meek will he guide in judgment,
and the meek will he teach his way.&#8217; It is for want
of this meekness, this humility of mind, that we are
soon angry. The apostle exhorts us &#8216;to be kindly
affectioned one towards another,&#8217; and live in unity
and godly love, and &#8216;bear ye one another&#8217;s burdens,
and so fulfil the law of Christ.&#8217; Situated as you are,
remote from all Christian society, and from the public
ordinances of religion, you will want, in a very especial
manner, the consolations which can only be derived
from the Holy Scriptures. You are in a barren and
thirsty land where no water is; you have none to give
you to drink of the waters of Bethlehem, and you
must not be surprised if you grow weary and faint in
your mind. Though God is everywhere, and his
presence fills heaven and earth, yet all places are not
equally favourable for the growth of religion in our
souls. We want Christian society; we want the
public ordinances; we want social worship. All these
are needful to keep up the life of God in our souls.
Without communion and fellowship with God, without
our souls are going forth after him, we cannot be easy,
we cannot be happy; we are dissatisfied with ourselves,
and with all around us. A little matter puts us out of
humour, Satan easily gains an advantage over us, we
become a prey to discontent, to murmuring, and are
prone to overlook all the great things the Lord hath
done for us. Under your peculiar circumstances you
will require much prayer, and much watchfulness;
religion is a very tender plant, it is soon injured, it
requires much nourishing in the most favourable situations,
but it calls for more attention, where it is more
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 199]</span>exposed to blights and storms. A plant removed
from a rich cultivated soil, into a barren uncultivated
spot soon droops and pines away. I hope this will not
be the case with you, though you must expect to feel
some change in your feelings of a religious nature.
Without much care the sabbaths will be a weariness;
instead of your soul being nourished and fed upon
this day, it will sicken, languish, and pine. I most
sincerely wish you had the gospel preached unto you;
this would be the greatest blessing, but it cannot be
at present. There is no man to care for your souls,
you have no shepherd to watch over you, and must
consider yourselves as sheep without a shepherd.
You know how easily sheep are scattered, how they
wander when left to themselves, how soon the wolves
destroy them. It is impossible to calculate the loss
you must suffer, for want of the public ordinances of
religion. My people, says God, perish for lack of
knowledge. You know it is true that there is a Saviour,
you have your Bible to instruct you, and you
have gained much knowledge of Divine things, but
still you will want feeding on the bread of life, you
will want Jesus to be set before your eyes continually
as crucified. You will want eternal things to be impressed
upon your minds from time to time. Though
you know these things, yet you will require to have
your minds stirred up, by being put in remembrance
of these things. As you cannot enjoy the public
ordinances, I would have you to have stated times for
reading the Scriptures and private prayer; these
means God may bless to your soul. Isaac lived in a
retired situation, he had no public ordinances to
attend, but we are told he planted a grove, and built
an altar, and called upon the name of the Lord. This
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 200]</span>you have within your power to do. Imitate his example,
labour to possess his precious faith, and then
it will be a matter of little importance where you
dwell. With the Saviour you will be happy, without
him you never can be. When you once believe on
him, when he becomes precious to your soul, then
you will seek all your happiness in him. May the
Father of mercies give you a right judgment in all
things, lead you to build your hopes of a blessed immortality
upon that chief corner stone, which he hath
laid in Zion; then you will never be ashamed through
the countless ages of eternity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. M. and my family unite in kind regards to
you, wishing you every blessing that the upper and
nether springs can afford.</p>

<p class="quotsig">&#8220;In great haste. I remain, dear Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash;,<br />
&#8220;Yours very faithfully,<br />

<p>Systematic theology, or indeed deep learning in any
of its branches, sacred or profane, Mr. Marsden had
never cultivated. His life had not been given to abstraction
and close study, but to the most active pursuits.
Activity, however, is not inconsistent with
deep thoughtfulness, and it affords some aids to reflection
and observation, which often lay the foundation
for a breadth of mind and a solid wisdom to which the
mere student or man of letters seldom attains. Mr.
Marsden, too, was well acquainted with his Bible, and,
above most men, with himself. Thus, without being
in any sense a learned divine, he was an instructive
minister, and often an original thinker. His early
acquaintance with Dr. Mason Good had led him
deeply to consider the question of the deity of Christ
and the following letter upon this all-important<span class="pagenum">[Pg 201]</span>
doctrine proves how capable he was of standing forward
in its defence, and how deeply alive he was to its importance.
It was addressed to one who had begun to
doubt upon the subject of our Lord&#8217;s Divine nature.</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Paramatta, June 13, 1825.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I ought to have answered your
letter long ago, but was prevented from one thing and
another, which called away my attention when I was determined
to write. I received the books you sent me.
That respecting our Lord&#8217;s Divinity I read with care
and attention. I found nothing in it that would
satisfy me; there was no food to the soul, no bread,
no water of life. I found nothing that suited my
ruined state. I know I have destroyed myself by my
iniquities, that I am hopeless and helpless, and must
be eternally undone unless I can find a Divine Saviour
who is able and willing to answer all the demands of
law and justice. If I were alone in the world, and no
individual but myself believed that Jesus was God
over all blessed for evermore, and that he had died for
my sins, that the penalty due to them was laid upon
him, I know and am persuaded unless I believed this
I could not be saved. I find no difficulty in my mind
in praying to him, because I believe he is able to save.
The dying thief did this in the very face of death:
&#8216;Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.&#8217;
Jesus promised that he should be with him
that very day in paradise. Stephen, we are told, was a
man full of faith and the Holy Ghost; he was mighty
in the Scriptures, so that none of the Jewish priests
were able to withstand his arguments which he advanced
in support of the doctrine that Jesus was the
Son of God. When he was brought to the place of
execution his only hope of eternal life was in Jesus.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 202]</span>&#8216;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit,&#8217; was his dying prayer.
He fled to him as the Almighty God at this most
awful period. No other foundation can any man lay
than that is laid, says St. Paul, which is Christ Jesus.
It is to no purpose to quote Scripture on this important
doctrine, I mean any particular passage, for
Jesus is the sum and substance of them all. I am
fully convinced that no man can have a well-grounded
hope of salvation unless he believes in the Divinity of
our Lord and only Saviour. I would ask you, why
should you not have as firm a hope as any other man
in the world of eternal life, if you do not believe in
the Divinity of our Lord? Admitting that you have
the same view as the author of the work you sent me
to read, of God and religion, I may put the question
to you, Can you depend on the foundation your hope
stands upon? Does it now give you full satisfaction?
Are you sure that you are right? I believe
Jesus to be a Divine person, I believe him to be God
over all; I have no doubt upon this point, and I believe
that all will be saved by him who trust in him
for salvation. This doctrine is as clear to me as the
sun at noon-day, and while I believe this doctrine it
administers comfort to my mind, and gives me hope
of a better state. I envy none their views of religion.
I am satisfied with my own, though I am not satisfied
with the attainments I have made in it, because I
have not made those advances in divine knowledge in
all the fruits of the Spirit I might have done. This is
matter of shame, and regret, and humiliation. Examine
the Christian religion as it stands revealed, with
prayer for Divine illumination, and that God who
giveth wisdom to all who call upon him for it will impart
it to you. I have never met with a Socinian who
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 203]</span>wished me to embrace his faith, which has surprised
me. I feel very differently. I wish all to believe in
our Lord, because I believe this is necessary to salvation,
as far as I understand the Scriptures; and I
would wish all men to be saved, and to come to the
knowledge of the truth. I would not change my
views of religion for ten thousand worlds. But I
must drop this subject, and reply to your last note.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Our affectionate regards to Mrs. F.; accept the same from,</p>

<p class="quotsig">&#8220;Dear sir, yours very sincerely,<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Samuel Marsden</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>He remembered with gratitude his early friends,
and was now in a condition to repay their kindness,
and in his turn to repeat the Christian liberality
which had once been extended to himself. From a
private letter to the Rev. J. Pratt, we venture to
make the following interesting quotation: &#8220;I believe
in the year 1786 I first turned my attention to the
ministry, and from the year 1787 to 1793 I received
pecuniary assistance, more or less, from the Elland
Society, but to what amount I never knew. First I
studied under the Rev. S. Stores, near Leeds. In
1788, I went to the late Rev. Joseph Milner, and
remained two years with him. From Hull I went to
Cambridge, and in 1793 I left Cambridge, was ordained,
and came out to New South Wales. I shall
be much obliged to you to learn, if you can, the
amount of my expenses to the Elland Society. I have
always considered <i>that</i> a just debt, which I ought to
pay. If you can send me the amount I shall be much
obliged to you. I purpose to pay the amount from
time to time, in sums not less than 50<i>l.</i> per annum.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 204]</span>
When I close the Society&#8217;s accounts on the 31st of
December next, I will give your Society credit for
50<i>l.</i>, and will thank you to pay the same to the Elland
Society on my account. When I know the whole
amount, I will then inform you how I purpose to
liquidate it. Should the Elland Society not be in
existence, I have to request that the Church Missionary
Society will assist some pious young man
with a loan, per annum, of not less than 50<i>l.</i>, to get
into the church as a missionary. In the midst of all
my difficulties God has always blessed my basket and
my store, and prospered me in all that I have set my
hand unto. The greatest part of my property is in
the charge of common felons, more than a hundred
miles from my house, in the woods, and much of it I
never saw, yet it has been taken care of, and will be.
A kind providence has watched over all that I have
had, and I can truly say I feel no more concern about
my sheep and cattle than if they were under my own
eye. I have never once visited the place where many
of them are, having no time to do this. We may
trust God with all we have. I wish to be thankful to
him who has poured out his benefits upon me and mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The practical wisdom, the spirit of calm submission
to the Divine will when danger appears, and the simple
faith in Christ displayed in the following letter require
no comment, nor will its affectionate and paternal tone
pass unnoticed. It appears to have been written to a
lady on the eve of a voyage to England. We could
wish that a copy of it were placed in the hands of
every lady who may be compelled to go to sea.</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Paramatta, May 27, 1826.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Dear Mrs.</span>&mdash;&mdash;,&mdash;Should you sail to-morrow
it will not be in my power to see you again. I feel
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 205]</span>much for your very trying situation; why and wherefore
you are so severely exercised remains at present
known to the only wise God. If time does not reveal
the mystery, eternity will. Clouds and darkness are
round about the paths of the Almighty, and his footsteps
are not known. You must now cast yourself
and your little ones upon the bosom of the great deep.
Remember always that he who holdeth the waters in
the hollow of his hand, will continually watch over
you and yours; winds and seas are under his sovereign
control. We are prone to imagine that we are in
much more danger on the seas than on dry land, but
this is not really the case; our times are all in his
hands, and if we only reflected that the hairs of our
heads are all numbered, we should often be relieved
from unnecessary and anxious fears. As for myself,
I am constrained to believe that I am as safe in a
storm as in a calm from what I have seen and known.
Should you meet with raging seas and stormy winds,
let not these distress you; they can do no more to
injure you than the breath of a fly, or the drop of a
bucket, without Divine permission. The promise is,
&#8216;When thou passest through the waters I will be with
thee.&#8217; This is sufficient for the Christian to rest upon.
You must live near to God in prayer. Labour to get
right views of the Redeemer, who gave his life as a
ransom for you. Humble faith in the Saviour will
enable you to overcome every trial and bear every
burden. No doubt but that you will have many
painful exercises before you see the shores of old
England. Tribulations will meet us, and follow us,
and attend us all our journey through, and it is
through much tribulation we must enter the kingdom
of God. Could you and I meet on your arrival in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 206]</span>London, and could we put our trials in opposite sides,
it is very probable that mine would overbalance yours
during the period you were at sea. You are not to
conclude when the storm blows hard, the waves roar,
and seas run mountain high, that you are more tried
and distressed than others.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope the captain will be kind to you and the
children; if he should not you will have no remedy
but patience. Should the servant woman behave ill,
you must submit to this also, because you can do no
good in complaining. Should the woman leave you ... this
is no more than what has happened to my own
family. I should recommend you to give the children
their dinner in your own cabin; never bring them to
table but at the particular request of the captain. This
precaution may prevent unpleasant disputes. You will
soon see what the feelings of the captain and his wife
are, and regulate your conduct accordingly. When I
returned to England, when I entered the ship I
resolved that I would not have any difference with any
one during my passage; whatever provocations I
might meet with, I would not notice them; and that
resolution I kept to the last.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you take no offence at anything, but go on
quietly your own way, those who would wish to annoy
you, will cease to do so, finding their labour in vain.
Never appear to see or hear anything that you have
not the power to remedy. If you should even know
that the persons intended to vex you, never notice their
conduct. There will be no occasions for these precautions
if your companions on board be such as they
ought to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let your passage be pleasant or not, take your
Bible for your constant companion. The comfort to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 207]</span>be derived from the Divine promises will always be
sweet and seasonable. &#8216;They that love thy law,&#8217; says
the Psalmist, &#8216;nothing shall offend them.&#8217; If Jesus be
precious to your soul, you will be able to bear every
trial with Divine submission. To believe that Jesus is
your Saviour, and that he is God over all blessed for
evermore, will make you happy in the midst of the
sea, as well as on dry land. Wishing you a safe and
pleasant passage, and a happy meeting of your friends
in England, and praying that the God of all grace may
preserve you and yours in his everlasting kingdom,
I subscribe myself,</p>

<p>More than two years had now passed since Mr.
Marsden&#8217;s last visit to New Zealand. The close of the
year 1826 found him preparing for another, his fifth
voyage, of twelve hundred miles, to the scene of those
missions he had so long regarded with all a parent&#8217;s
fondness. A great change had just taken place in the
conduct of several chiefs towards the missionaries
in consequence of their fierce intestine wars. At
Wangaroa the whole of the Wesleyan missionary
premises had been destroyed; the property of all the
missionaries was frequently plundered, and their lives
were exposed to the greatest danger. The worst
consequences were apprehended, and the missionaries,
warned of their danger by the friendly natives, were in
daily expectation of being at least stripped of everything
they possessed, according to the New Zealand
custom. For a time the Wesleyan mission was suspended,
and their pious and zealous missionary, Mr.
Turner, took refuge at Sydney, and found a home at
the parsonage of Paramatta. The clergy of the church<span class="pagenum">[Pg 208]</span>
mission deeply sympathized with him. Mr. Henry
Williams writes: &#8220;The return of Mr. Turner will be a
convincing proof of our feelings on this point. In the
present unsettled state of things we consider ourselves
merely as tenants for the time being, who may receive
our discharge at any hour.&#8221; His brother, the Rev.
William Williams, in another communication says:
&#8220;We are prepared to depart or stay according to the
conduct of the natives; for it is, I believe, our united
determination to remain until we are absolutely driven
away. When the natives are in our houses, carrying
away our property, it will then be time for us to take
refuge in our boats.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as the painful intelligence reached New
South Wales, Mr. Marsden determined to proceed to
the Bay of Islands, and use his utmost exertions to
prevent the abandonment of the mission. He was
under no apprehension of suffering injury from the
natives; and his long acquaintance with their character
and habits led him to anticipate that the storm would
soon pass away. Accordingly, he sailed for New Zealand
in H.M.S. Rainbow, and arrived in the Bay of
Islands on the 5th April, 1827. He had reached the
period of life when even the most active crave for some
repose, and feel themselves entitled to the luxury of rest;
but his ardent zeal never seems to have wanted other
refreshment than a change of duties and of scene. He
found the state of things improved; peace had been
restored; and the missionaries were once more out of
danger. He conferred with them, and gave them
spiritual counsel. As far as time would permit, he
reasoned with the chiefs upon the baneful consequences
of the late war, and, at the end of five days from his
arrival, he was again upon the ocean, on his way back<span class="pagenum">[Pg 209]</span>
to Sydney. &#8220;He was not wanted in New Zealand;&#8221;
in Australia, besides domestic cares, many circumstances
combined to make his presence desirable.
Thus he was instant in season, out of season; disinterested,
nay indifferent and utterly regardless of the
honours and preferments which even good men covet;
and ever finding in the work itself, and in Him for the
love of whom it was undertaken, an abundant recompense.</p>

<p>Brief as the visit was, it confirmed his faith, and
reassured his confidence in the speedy conversion of
New Zealand. He found the missionaries living in
unity and godly love, and devoting themselves to the
work. &#8220;I trust,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that the Great Head of
the church will bless their labours.&#8221; In consequence of
his co-operation with the missionaries, the beneficial
labours of the press now for the first time reached the
Maori tribes. During a visit to Sydney, Mr. Davis
had carried through the press a translation of the first
three chapters of Genesis, the twentieth of Exodus,
part of the fifth of Matthew, the first of John, and
some hymns. These were small beginnings, but not
to be despised; they prepared the way for the translation
of the New Testament into Maori, which was
printed a few years afterwards at the expense of the
British and Foreign Bible Society. The importance
of this work can scarcely be estimated, and it affords
a striking example of the way in which that noble
institution becomes the silent handmaid, preparing the
rich repast which our various missionary societies are
ever more distributing abroad, with bounteous hand,
to feed the starving myriads of the heathen world.</p>

<p>Nor was the Polynesian mission forgotten by its
old friend. The London Missionary Society now<span class="pagenum">[Pg 210]</span>
conducted its affairs on so wide a basis, and to so great
an extent, that Mr. Marsden&#8217;s direct assistance was no
longer wanted. But how much he loved the work,
how much he revered the missionaries, those who shall
read the extract with which this chapter concludes
will be at no loss to judge.</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Paramatta, February 4, 1826.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;It is not long since I wrote to you,
but as a friend of mine is returning, the Rev. Mr.
Nott, who has been twenty-seven years a missionary
in the Society Islands, I could not deny myself the
pleasure of introducing him to you. Mr. Nott was
one of the first missionaries who was sent out to the
Islands. Like Caleb, he always said the missionaries
were able to take the land. He remained a
long time in Tahiti alone, labouring by himself when
all his colleagues were gone, and lived with and as the
natives, under the full persuasion that the mission
would succeed. He remained breaking up the ground,
sowing the gospel seed, until he saw it spring up, and
waiting until part of the harvest was gathered in,
until many of the poor heathen crossed the river
Jordan, with the heavenly Canaan full in view. Such
have been the fruits of his patient perseverance and
faith. Should his life be spared, I shall expect to see
him again in fourteen months returning to his labours,
to die amongst his people, and to be buried with
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I venerate the man more than you can conceive:
in my estimation, he is a great man: his piety, his
simplicity, his meekness, his apostolic appearance, all
unite to make him great in my view, and more honourable
than any of the famed heroes of ancient or
modern times. I think Mrs. Good will like to see
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 211]</span>such a character return from a savage nation, whom
God has so honoured in his work. I shall leave Mr.
Nott to tell his own story, while you listen to his
report....</p>

<p class="quotsig">&#8220;I remain, my dear sir,<br />
&#8220;Your&#8217;s affectionately,<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Samuel Marsden</span>.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<blockquote><p>Death of Dr. Mason Good&mdash;Malicious Charges brought against Mr.
Marsden and confuted&mdash;Sixth Voyage to New Zealand&mdash;Frightful
state of the Island&mdash;Battle of the Maories&mdash;Their Cannibalism&mdash;Progress
of the Mission&mdash;Mr. Marsden&#8217;s return&mdash;Death of Mrs.
Marsden&mdash;Anticipation of his own decease.</p></blockquote>

<p>The shadows of evening now began to fall on him
whose life had hitherto been full of energy, and to
whom sickness appears to have been a stranger. He
had arrived at the period when early friendships are
almost extinct, and the few who survive are dropping
into the grave. The year 1827 witnessed the death of
Dr. Mason Good. Nearly twenty years had elapsed
since he and Mr. Marsden had taken leave of one
another; but their friendship had not cooled during
that long term of absence; it seems rather to have
gained strength with distance and declining years.
Dr. Mason Good felt, and gratefully acknowledged,
that to the conversations, and yet more to the high
example of Mr. Marsden, he owed it, under God, that
he was led to seek, through faith in Jesus, that holiness
and peace which he found at last, and which shed
so bright a lustre on his closing years. He had seen
in his friend a living instance of disinterestedness,
zeal, and humility combined, all springing from the
love of God, and directed for Christ&#8217;s sake towards
the welfare of man; such as he had never seen before&mdash;such
as, he confessed, his own Socinian principles
were incapable of producing. Far his superior as a
scholar and a man of genius, he perceived and felt his
inferiority in all that relates to the highest destinies
of man; he sat, as a little child, a learner, in his pre<span class="pagenum">[Pg 213]</span>sence;
and God, who is rich in mercy, brought home
the lessons to his soul.</p>

<p>Nothing, on the other hand, could exceed the respect,
almost amounting to reverence, mingled however with
the warmest affection, with which Mr. Marsden viewed
his absent friend. In every difficulty he had recourse
to him for advice; more than once he intrusted the
defence of his character and reputation entirely to his
discretion. A correspondence of nearly twenty years,
a few specimens of which are in the reader&#8217;s hand,
show the depth of his esteem. Upon his death a fuller
tide of affection gushed out; while he wrote thus to
the mourning widow:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Paramatta, November 9, 1827.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Good</span>,&mdash;A few days ago we received
two letters from your daughter M&mdash;, informing us of
the death of your much revered husband. I had seen
his death noticed in one of the London papers, but
had not received any other information. I feel for all
your loss. He was a blessing to the Christian world,
and to mankind at large. No one I esteemed more,
and his memory will always be dear to me. When I
was with you, he and I had many serious conversations
on the subject of religion.</p>

<p>&#8220;His great talents, united with his child-like simplicity,
interested me much. I always experienced
the greatest pleasure in his company, as well as advantage;
in knowledge I found myself an infant in his
presence, but yet at perfect ease. His gentle manners,
his mild address, often made me forget to whom I was
speaking; and after retiring from his presence I, on
reflecting, have been ashamed that I should presume
to talk to him as I had done, as if he were my equal.
I never could account for the ease and freedom I felt
in his company, in giving my opinion upon the various
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 214]</span>subjects we were wont to converse upon. He was a
very learned man, and knew a thousand times more of
men and things than I did, excepting on the subject
of religion; here I always felt myself at home; and he
would attend to what I said with the sweetest simplicity
and the greatest openness of mind. In our various
conversations on the most important doctrines of the
gospel, he manifested a humble desire to know the truth,
though he proceeded with great caution. I experienced
no difficulty in my own mind in urging the truths of
religion upon him, by every argument in my power.
I always saw, or thought I saw, the Day-star from on
high dawning upon his mind; and my own soul was
animated and refreshed whenever the subjects of the
gospel engaged our conversation. Perhaps our mutual
friend, Dr. Gregory, may remember the observations I
made to him, on what passed between your dear husband
and myself, respecting religion, and what were
my views of the state of his mind at that time; the
period to which I allude was when he joined the
Church Missionary Society, or intended to join it. I
had the firmest conviction in my mind that he would
embrace the gospel, and cordially believe to the salvation
of his soul. I could never account for that love
which I have continued to have for Dr. Good, even
here at the ends of the earth, but from the <i>communion
of saints</i>. Though the affliction of yourself and your
dear daughters must be severe, having lost such a
husband and father, yet you cannot sorrow as those
without hope; you must be satisfied that the Lord
has taken him away from the evil to come; and as he
cannot now return to you, comfort one another with
the hope that you shall go to him. He finished his
course with joy, and the work that had been given
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 215]</span>him to do; and came to the grave like a shock of corn
that was fully ripe. This consideration should reconcile
you to the Divine dispensation, and constrain
you to say, &#8216;Not my will, but Thine be done.&#8217; You
and your dear husband had travelled long together;
few in this miserable world were so happy and blessed
as you were for so long a period. Remember all the
way the Lord hath led you in this wilderness; recall
to mind his mercies of old, and bless his name. I have
long wished to see you face to face; but that wish
will never be gratified. The day may come when, in
another and a better world, we may recount all our
travels here below. We are sure that we are fast
approaching to the end of our journey, and shall soon
arrive at the banks of Jordan. Let us labour, my dear
madam, to keep the promised land in view. You
have the consolation of your two amiable daughters&#8217;
company. I have never thought of Mrs. N. but with
feelings of sympathy, and regret for her loss in the
death of her excellent husband. How mysterious are
the ways of God! We cannot account for them now,
but we shall know hereafter. As a father pitieth his
own children, so is the Lord merciful unto them that
fear him. Mrs. Neale may derive comfort from the
Divine promises. There are many made to the widow
and the fatherless, and God is never unmindful of his
promises. When we arrive in Mount Zion, we shall
then be satisfied with all the Divine dispensations, and
see cause to bless God for the severest. Give my love
to Miss Good; tell her how much I am obliged to
her, for the communication she has made to me respecting
her dear father....</p>

<p class="quotsig">&#8220;I am yours, very sincerely,&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 216]</span>He was still subject to the persecutions of &#8220;unreasonable
and wicked men,&#8221; and was again compelled to
vindicate his conduct in a pamphlet, which issued
from the press at Sydney, in 1828. Transmitting a
copy to his friend, the Rev. Josiah Pratt, he says: &#8220;I
consider myself a proscribed person these last few
years. All the charges against me are contained in
this pamphlet. My public offences, my illegal acts,
the charges against me for inflicting torture to extort
confession, for which I have been condemned unheard,
and suffered as guilty. What an ungodly world may
think or say of me, is of little moment; but I do not
wish to lose the good opinion of my Christian friends,
and fall in their estimation.&#8221; He returns to the
subject in his correspondence with other Christian
friends; for the apprehension that in him the cause of
religion might seem to have received a wound, lay heavy
on his mind. &#8220;I should feel much,&#8221; he says, writing
to Mr. D. Coates, &#8220;if the cause of religion should suffer
in my personal conduct; but I hope it will not. I hope
I have said enough to satisfy the Christian world that
I am clear in this matter. To justify my public conduct,
was an act due to my family and to all my
Christian friends, as well as the general interests of
religion.&#8221; Nor was it merely the breath of slander
that assailed him: he mentions in a private letter to
the Rev. Edward Bickersteth, an act of grievous wrong
inflicted by the British government. &#8220;I and my
family were all struck off the public victualling books
in the latter part of Governor Macquarie&#8217;s administration,
without any compensation. The Rev. R.
Cartwright and the Rev. William Cooper, with their
families, were also struck off from the public stores at
the same time. They have both had their claims<span class="pagenum">[Pg 217]</span>
settled since governor Darling arrived. One received
700<i>l.</i>, and the other more than 800<i>l.</i>; but I have
received nothing. My claim is equally just, had I
only served the same period as my colleagues, though
I have served nearly twenty years longer than either
of them. I can only attribute this act of injustice to
some hostile feeling in the colonial office. Governor
Darling has always shown me every attention I could
wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet he uttered no protest; he raised no clamour
for redress. &#8220;I mention this circumstance to you,&#8221;
he adds, &#8220;<i>confidentially</i>: when the truth of my case is
laid before the public, perhaps my superiors may
think differently of my conduct, and do me common
justice.&#8221; Whether he obtained redress we are not
informed. The occurrence shows the depth and bitterness
of those hostile feelings, which we can trace to
no other cause on his part than his boldness in rebuking
vice, and his fidelity to the cause of his Lord
and Master.</p>

<p>The year 1830 found Mr. Marsden once more upon
the ocean. For neither increasing years nor the
vexations through which he had passed damped his
ardour in the missionary cause. His mind was stedfastly
fixed on the progress of the gospel in New
Zealand, and there he was anxious once more in person
to assist in carrying on the work. He felt that his
time was growing short, and hastened, &#8220;before his
decease,&#8221; to &#8220;set in order the things which were
wanting.&#8221;</p>

<p>He perceived, too, with mingled feelings, that New
Zealand was about to undergo a great change. His
efforts to induce the chiefs to unite under one head or
sovereign elected by themselves, had totally failed.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 218]</span>
Shunghie had been slain in battle, and his ambitious
projects of gaining a New Zealand throne by conquest
were at an end. War was the natural condition of all
the Maori tribes, and this, rendered more deadly,
though possibly less ferocious, by the introduction of
fire-arms, was fearfully thinning their numbers from
year to year. They were subject, too, to periodical
returns of a terrible scourge, a disease resembling the
influenza, which cut off multitudes. On the whole,
it was calculated, that not more than a hundred thousand
Maories now survived; while twenty years before,
when the island was first visited, the numbers were at
least two hundred thousand. It was evident that they
could not long maintain their independence as a
nation. European ships began to crowd the Bay of
Islands. English settlers were already making their
way into their choice and fertile lands. To minds less
sagacious than Mr. Marsden&#8217;s, the result could be no
longer doubtful&mdash;New Zealand must become an
English colony. He foresaw the necessity, and, though
at first with reluctance, cordially acquiesced in it, even
for the sake of the Maories themselves. His concern
now was to prepare them for a measure which must
sooner or later take place. Everything was in a lawless
state; the progress of the missions was greatly
interrupted, and his presence was once more highly
necessary. His own anxiety was great, first on behalf
of the missions which had so long been the especial
objects of his care; and then for New Zealand at large
that the policy of Great Britain should respect the
rights of the native tribes and pledge itself to their
protection.</p>

<p>On his arrival in New Zealand, in March, 1830, he
was greeted before the ship had cast anchor by the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 219]</span>
Messrs. Williams and others of the missionary band,
who hastened on board, and expressed their joy at his
unexpected appearance among them. It was a critical
moment, for they were in greater anxiety and difficulty
than they had experienced at any former period of the
mission. The natives were at open war, and but a
day or two before a great battle had been fought on
the opposite beach of the Bay of Islands, in which
about fourteen hundred had been engaged. The
alleged cause of the war was the misconduct of an
English captain who had offered indignities to some
native women on board his vessel. One tribe espoused
his cause, while another came forward to avenge the
insult. Six chiefs had fallen in the battle, and a hundred
lives were lost; several whaling vessels were
lying in the Bay, and their crews as well as the missionary
stations, were in the utmost peril from the
revenge of the victorious tribe, which now lay encamped
at Keri-Keri.</p>

<p>There was not an hour to be lost. Mr. Marsden
crossed the bay with Mr. Henry Williams early the
next morning, to visit the camp as a mediator. The
chiefs, many of whom from different parts of the
island, had formerly been acquainted with Mr.
Marsden, all expressed their gratification at meeting
him again. After conversing with them on different
points connected with proposals of peace, the two
friendly mediators crossed over to the camp of their
opponents, and entered at once on the subject of their
mission. They spoke to them of the evils of war, and
more particularly of the civil war in which they were
engaged. &#8220;They heard all we had to say with great
attention, and several of them replied to the different
arguments we had used. They contended<span class="pagenum">[Pg 220]</span>
that we were answerable for the lives of those who
had fallen in the battle, as the war had been occasioned
by the misconduct of the captain of a vessel
one of our own countrymen; they wished to know
what satisfaction we would give them for the loss of
their friends who had been slain. We replied that we
could give them no satisfaction, that we condemned
his conduct, and were sorry that any of our countrymen
had behaved so badly, and that we would write to
England and prevent his return.&#8221; This the savages
requested that Mr. Marsden would not do; they
longed for his return, that they might take their own
revenge. Mr. Marsden then proceeded to inform them
that he had had an interview with the chiefs on the
other side, who were willing to come to terms of peace,
and wished him to assist in settling their quarrel.
This information was received in a friendly way by
the greater part: one or two still wished to fight.
The mediators now returned to the beach, which they
found covered with war canoes and armed men. A
war council was held, and the Rev. Henry Williams
stated the business upon which they had come amongst
them. The natives listened attentively. Many of
the chiefs gave their opinion in turn, with much force
and dignity of address. These orations continued
from an early hour in the morning, till the shades of
evening were closing. It was finally agreed that the
mediating party should proceed the next morning to
the opposite camp and repeat what had taken place.
After a long discussion, it was concluded that two
commissioners from each party should be appointed,
along with Mr. Marsden and Mr. Williams, to conclude
the terms of peace. Having now urged all that
was in their power to bring about a reconciliation,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 221]</span>
they walked over the ground where the battle had
been fought; a dreadful scene under any circumstances,
unutterably loathsome, where cannibals were
the contending parties. &#8220;The remains of some of the
bodies that had been slain were lying unconsumed on
the fires; the air was extremely offensive, and the
scene most disgusting. We could not but bitterly
lament these baneful effects of sin, and the influence
of the prince of darkness over the minds of the poor
heathen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday, it was spent by Mr.
Williams at the camp, for it was not considered safe at
present to leave the savage warriors, whose angry passions
smouldered. Mr. Marsden proceeded to the station,
and preached to the infant church. Never was the gospel
of Christ placed in finer contrast with the kingdom of
darkness, and the appalling tyranny of the god of
this world. Mr. Marsden&#8217;s pen thus describes the
scene as he sketched it upon the spot:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The contrast between the state of the east and
west side of the bay was very striking. Though only
two miles distant, the east shore was crowded with
different tribes of fighting men in a wild savage state,
many of them nearly naked, and when exercising
entirely naked; nothing was to be heard but the
firing of muskets, the noise, din, and commotion of
a savage military camp; some mourning the death of
their friends, others suffering from their wounds, and
not one but whose mind was involved in heathen
darkness without one ray of Divine knowledge. On
the other side was the pleasant sound of the church
going bell; the natives assembling together for divine
worship, clean, orderly and decently dressed, most of
them in European clothing; they were carrying the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 222]</span>
litany and the greatest part of the church service,
written in their own language, in their hands with
their hymns. The church service, as far as it has
been translated, they can write and read. Their
conduct and the general appearance of the whole
settlement reminded me of a well-regulated English
country parish. In the chapel, the natives behaved
with the greatest propriety, and joined in the church
service. Here might be viewed at one glance the
blessings of the Christian religion, and the miseries of
heathenism with respect to the present life; but when
we extend one thought over the eternal world how
infinite is the difference!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>These were trying times undoubtedly. The
missions had existed fifteen years, and yet the powers
of darkness raged in all the horrors of cannibal
warfare, close to the doors of the missionary premises.
On the following Tuesday morning, Mr. Marsden was
aroused from his bed by a chief calling at his window
to tell him that the army was in motion, and that a
battle seemed to be at hand. He arose immediately
and was informed that thirty-six canoes had been
counted passing between the main and the island.
He immediately launched the missionary boat and
proceeded to meet them. &#8220;When we came up to
them we found they had left their women and children
on the island, and that they were all fighting men,
well armed and ready for action in a moment&#8217;s notice. I
counted more than forty men in one war canoe.&#8221;
Yet amongst these infuriated savages the missionaries
felt no alarm. &#8220;We were under no apprehension of
danger; both parties placed the utmost confidence in
us, and we were fully persuaded the commissioners
would be cordially received.&#8221; If the event had turned<span class="pagenum">[Pg 223]</span>
out otherwise Mr. Marsden and his friends had
notice given them by the native commissioners, of
whom we have spoken, that they would be seen alive no
more. &#8220;The three native commissioners accompanied
us in a small canoe which they paddled themselves.
They brought their canoe between our two boats, and
in that position we approached the beach. They
told us if they were killed, we must be given up
to their friends as a sacrifice for the loss of their
lives.&#8221; The missionaries&#8217; confidence was not misplaced;
&#8220;the whole day was spent in deliberation;
at night, after a long oration, the great chief on one
side clove a stick in two to signify that his anger was
broken. The terms of peace were ratified, and both
sides joined in a hideous war dance together; repeatedly
firing their muskets. We then took our
departure from these savage scenes with much satisfaction,
as we had attained the object we were
labouring for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such scenes did not for an instant disturb the firm
faith and confidence of the great missionary leader.
Coming from the midst of them he could sit down in
the missionary hut and write as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The time will come when human sacrifices and
cannibalism shall be annihilated in New Zealand, by
the pure, mild and heavenly influence of the gospel
of our blessed Lord and Saviour. The work is great,
but Divine goodness will find both the means and the
instruments to accomplish his own gracious purposes
to fallen man. His word, which is the sword of the
Spirit, is able to subdue these savage people to the
obedience of faith. It is the duty of Christians to use
the means, to sow the seed and patiently to wait for the
heavenly dews to cause it to spring up, and afterwards<span class="pagenum">[Pg 224]</span>
to look up to God in faith and prayer to send the
early and latter rain.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Even now the &#8220;Day-spring from on high&#8221; had visited
this savage race. In no part of the world was the
sabbath day more sacredly observed than by the
converts in the missionary settlements; their lives
gave evidence that their hearts were changed. Spiritual
religion, deep and earnest, began to show its
fruit in some of them; others were at least much
impressed with the importance of eternal things.
Mr. Marsden was waited upon one evening by several
native young men and women who wished to converse
on religious subjects; when they came in their
anxious countenances explained the inward working
of their minds; their object was to know what they
must do to be saved. He endeavoured to set before
them the love of Jesus in coming from heaven to die
for a ruined world, and mentioned many instances of
his love and mercy which he showed to sinners while
on earth. &#8220;When I had addressed them at some
length,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;a young native woman begun to
pray.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard any address offered up to heaven
with such feelings of reverence, and piety, so much
sweetness and freedom of expression, with such
humility and heavenly mindedness. I could not doubt
but that this young woman prayed with the Spirit, and
with the understanding. She prayed fervently that
God would pardon her sins and preserve her from
evil; and for all the natives in the room, that they
might all be preserved from falling into the temptations
by which they were surrounded. Her very soul
seemed to be swallowed up with the sense she had of
the evil and danger of sin, and the love of Jesus, who<span class="pagenum">[Pg 225]</span>
came to save sinners. Her voice was low, soft and
harmonious; her sentences were short and expressed
in the true spirit of prayer. I never expected to have
seen, in my day, any of the natives of this barbarous
nation offering up their supplications for pardon and
grace, to the only true God, with such godly sorrow
and true contrition.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amongst the audience in the room were the aged
widow and two daughters of the great Shunghie.
When they rose from their knees the ex-queen exclaimed,
&#8220;Astonishing, astonishing!&#8221; and then retired;
&#8220;and I confess,&#8221; adds Mrs. Marsden, &#8220;I was not less
astonished than she was.&#8221; The young woman he
learned had for some time lived upon the mission premises,
and conducted herself in all respects as a
Christian, adorning the gospel she professed. A few
days after we find Mr. Marsden &#8220;marrying an Englishman
to a native Christian woman, who repeated the
responses very correctly in English which she well
understood; she conducted herself with the greatest
propriety, and appeared neatly dressed in European
clothing of her own making, for she was a good sempstress.&#8221;
Mr. Marsden considered, he says, this marriage
to be of the first importance; and the New Zealanders
appear to have been of the same mind, and to have done
due honour to the occasion: for &#8220;the company came
in a war canoe and brought their provisions with
them, a pig and plenty of potatoes.&#8221; Shortly afterwards,
he united a young native man and woman in
marriage, they were both Christians, domestic servants
to Mr. Clarke, one of the missionaries, and seemed to
have a great affection for each other. The young man
was free and of a good family; the young woman was
a slave, having become such by capture; for all their<span class="pagenum">[Pg 226]</span>
prisoners of war if not massacred were reduced to
slavery. Mr. Clarke therefore redeemed her from her
master, for five blankets, an axe, and an iron-pot. A
chief seldom allowed any of his female slaves to marry,
always reserving a number of them as wives for himself.
We must therefore suppose that the price was
a very liberal one.</p>

<p>The effects of Christianity were now apparent in
some favoured spots, and Mr. Marsden returned home
again full of hope and consolation. He had witnessed
already changes far greater than he had ever hoped to
see, sanguine as he was of ultimate success. So confident
was he in the good feeling of the natives towards
himself, that he had taken one of his daughters with
him, and she accompanied him in his visits to the
chiefs, one of whom, known by the title of King George,
demanded her in marriage for his son; &#8220;an honour,&#8221;
writes her father, &#8220;which I begged permission to decline.&#8221;
Fearful indeed had been the condition of
females hitherto amongst these savages, as the following
extract, with which we conclude our notice of Mr.
Marsden&#8217;s sixth visit to New Zealand, sufficiently
attests. He is describing the great change which
Christianity had effected among the New Zealanders.</p>

<p>&#8220;On one of my former visits to New Zealand, sitting
in the room I am at present in, the natives killed
and ate a poor young woman just behind the house.
But what a wonderful change the gospel has wrought!
In this little spot, where so late hellish songs were sung
and heathen rites performed, I now hear the songs of
Zion, and the voice of prayer offered up to the God of
heaven. So wonderful is the power of God&#8217;s word.&#8221;</p>

<p>He returned home greatly cheered and well qualified
&#8220;to comfort others with the comforts wherewith&#8221; he<span class="pagenum">[Pg 227]</span>
himself &#8220;was comforted of God.&#8221; To Mrs. Good, the
widow of his departed friend, he wrote as follows, soon
afterwards:</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Paramatta, August 27, 1833.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Good</span>,&mdash;We received Miss Good&#8217;s
letter, which gave us much concern to learn that you
had met with such severe trials.... How
mysterious are the ways of God! We cannot comprehend
them now, but we are assured, that what we
know not at present we shall know hereafter. Our
heavenly Father has promised that all things shall
work together for good to them that love God, and
the Scriptures cannot be broken. He willingly suffers
none of his children to be afflicted. In the end we
shall find that he hath done all things well. At
present our trials may bear heavy upon us, but St.
Paul tells us they are but for a moment, and eventually
will work for us a far more exceeding weight of eternal
glory. Job, when he had lost all his children and
property exclaimed, &#8216;Naked came I out of my mother&#8217;s
womb, and naked shall I return; the Lord gave and
the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of
the Lord.&#8217; We know Infinite Wisdom cannot err in
any of his dispensations towards us, and he will never
leave or forsake them that trust in him. I pray that
the Father of mercies may support you under all your
trials and afflictions. The very remembrance of the
pleasure I experienced in the society of your ever-to-be-revered
husband is very refreshing to my mind.
We often speak of you all, and humbly pray that
we may meet again in another and a better
world. I am now almost seventy years old, and
I cannot but be thankful, when I look back and
consider how the Lord hath led me all my life long.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 228]</span>I have gone through many dangers by land, by water,
amongst the heathen and amongst my own countrymen,
robbers and murderers, by night and by day;
but though I have been robbed, no personal injury
have I ever received, not so much as a bone broken.
I have also had to contend with many wicked and unreasonable
men in power, but the Lord in his providence
ordered all for good. Most of them are now
in the silent grave, and I have much peace and comfort
in the discharge of my public duty, and I bless
God for it. I have visited New Zealand six times.
The mission prospers very much; the Lord has blessed
the missionaries in their labours, and made their
work to prosper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am happy to say my family are all pretty well....
Mrs. M. enjoys her health well at her
age, so that we have everything to be thankful for.
The colony increases very fast in population; 599
women arrived from Europe a few days ago.
Provisions are very cheap and in great plenty. Our
number increases some thousands every year, so that
there is a prospect of this country becoming great and
populous. Your daughter mentions the sheep; she
will be astonished to hear that one million eight
hundred thousand pounds of wool, were exported last
year from New South Wales to England, and we may
expect a very great annual increase from the fineness
of the climate, and the extent of pasturage....
Wool will prove the natural wealth of these colonies
and of vast importance to the mother country also.
We are very much in want of pious ministers....
None but pious men will be of any service in such a
society as ours.... I should wish to go to England
again to select some ministers, if I were not so
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 229]</span>very old; but this I cannot do, and therefore I must
pray to the great Head of the church, to provide
for those sheep who are without a shepherd.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I request you to remember us affectionately
to Mrs. Neale and Dr. Gregory&mdash;I pray that you
and yours may be supported under every trial, and
that they may be all sanctified to your eternal
good. I remain, dear Mrs. Good,</p>

<p class="quotsig">&#8220;Yours affectionately.<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Samuel Marsden</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1835, Mrs. Marsden died. She had long been
patiently looking forward to her great change, and her
last end was full of peace. Years had not abated his
love for his &#8220;dear partner;&#8221; so he always called her
when, after her decease, he had occasion to speak of
her. He showed her grave, in sight of his study
window, with touching emotion to his friends, and
felt himself almost released from earth and its attractions
when she had left it. His own increasing
infirmities had led him to anticipate that he should
be first removed, and the parsonage house being
his only by a life tenure, he had built a comfortable
residence for his widow, which however, she did
not live to occupy. By this bereavement he was himself
led to view the last conflict as near at hand;
henceforward it constantly occupied his mind, and
formed at times the chief subject of his conversation.
He sometimes spoke of it amongst his friends with a
degree of calmness, and at the same time with such a
deep sense of its nearness and reality, as to excite their
apprehensions as well as their astonishment. He stood
on the verge of eternity and gazed into it with a
tranquil eye, and spoke of what he saw with the
composure of one who was &#8220;now ready to be offered,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 230]</span>
and the time of whose departure was at hand;&#8221;&mdash;his last
text before he had quitted New Zealand.</p>

<p>Yet he was not at all times equally serene. Returning
one day from a visit to a dying bed, he called
at the residence of a brother minister, the Rev. R.
Cartwright, in a state of some dejection. He entered
on the subject of death with feeling, and expressed
some fears with regard to his own salvation. Mr.
Cartwright remarked upon the happiness of himself and
his friend as being both so near to their eternal rest,
to which Mr. Marsden seriously replied with emphasis,
&#8220;But Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, <i>if</i> I am there.&#8221; &#8220;If, Mr. Marsden?&#8221;
rejoined his friend, surprised at the doubt implied.
The aged disciple then brought forward several passages
of Scripture bearing upon the deep responsibility of
the ministerial office coupled with his own unworthiness;
&#8220;lest I myself should be a castaway;&#8221; &#8220;if we
hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto
the end;&#8221; remarking on his own sinfulness,&mdash;every
thing he had done being tainted with sin,&mdash;on his utter
uselessness,&mdash;and contrasting all this with the holiness
and purity of God. At another time, coming from
the factory after a visit to a dying woman, and deeply
impressed with the awfulness of a dying hour in the
case of one who was unprepared to die, he repeated in
a very solemn manner some lines from Blair&#8217;s once
celebrated poem on the grave&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 28em;">
<span class="i0">&#8220;In that dread moment how the frantic soul</span>
<span class="i0">Raves round the walls of her clay tenement,</span>
<span class="i0">Runs to each avenue and shrieks for help,</span>
<span class="i0">But shrieks in vain. How wistfully she looks</span>
<span class="i0">On all she is leaving; now no longer hers.</span>
<span class="i0">A little longer, yet a little longer. Oh! might she stay</span>
<span class="i0">To wash away her crimes, and fit her for her passage.&#8221;</span>
</div>

<p>He then spoke on the plan of salvation and the
grace offered by the gospel with great feeling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 231]</span>The holiness and purity of God appeared at times to
overwhelm his soul; contrasting it, as he did, with his
own sinfulness, and viewing it in connexion with the
fact that he must soon stand before his awful presence.
Yet he speedily recovered his habitual peace, recalling
the blessed truth that &#8220;there is now no condemnation
to them which are in Christ Jesus.&#8221; He was still on the
whole a most cheerful Christian, joying and rejoicing
in the hope of a blessed immortality. And as he drew
near his journey&#8217;s end his prospects were still brighter
and his peace increased.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<blockquote><p>State of New South Wales&mdash;The Aborigines&mdash;Cruelties practised upon

Marsden&#8217;s Seventh Visit to New Zealand&mdash;His Daughter&#8217;s Journal&mdash;Affection

<p>History affords but few examples of a change such as
New South Wales had undergone since Mr. Marsden
landed from a convict ship in the penal settlement of
Botany Bay in the year 1794. The gold fields
had not yet disclosed their wealth, nor did he live
to see the stupendous consequences which resulted
from their discovery in 1851, the rush of European
adventurers, and the sudden transformation of the
dismal solitudes of Bendigo and Ballarat into the abode
of thousands of restless, enterprising men, with all the
attendant circumstances, both good and evil, of civilized
life. But Australia was already a vast colony; in
almost everything except the name, an empire, self-supporting,
and with regard to its internal affairs, self
governed, though still under the mild control, borne
with loyalty and pride, of the English sovereign. The
state of society was completely changed. For many
years, the stream of emigration had carried to the
fertile shores of Australia not the refuse of our jails,
but some of the choicest of our population; the young,
the intelligent, the enterprising, and the high principled,
who sought for a wider field of action, or
disdained to live at home, useless to society, and a
burden to their relatives. Large towns such as<span class="pagenum">[Pg 235]</span>Sydney, Victoria, Geelong and Melbourne, with their
spacious harbours crowded with shipping, were already
in existence, and English settlers had covered with
their flocks those inland plains which long after Mr.
Marsden&#8217;s arrival still lay desolate and unexplored.</p>

<p>The religious condition of Australia was no less
changed. All denominations were now represented
by a ministry, and accommodated in places of worship
not at all inferior to those at home. The Church of
England had erected Sydney into a bishopric, of which
the pious and energetic archdeacon Broughton was
the first incumbent, and the number of the colonial
clergy had been greatly increased; under all these
influences the tone of social morality was improved,
and real spiritual religion won its triumphs in many
hearts. Mr. Marsden was now released from those
official cares and duties as senior chaplain which once
so heavily pressed upon him. Beyond his own parish
of Paramatta his ministerial labours did not necessarily
extend, and in his parish duties he had the efficient aid
of his son-in-law and other coadjutors.</p>

<span class="caption">PARAMATTA CHURCH</span>
</div>

<p>The one spot on which no cheering ray seemed to
fall, the sterile field which after years of laborious
cultivation yielded no return, was the native population,
the aborigines of New South Wales.</p>

<p>We have mentioned some of the many futile attempts
made for their conversion; more might be added; for
various missions were devised,&mdash;by the Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, aided by
the colonial government; by the Wesleyan and the
Church Missionary Societies; and by the London
Missionary Society; but none of these met with much
success, and we fear all have been in turn abandoned.
The mission of Mr. Threlkeld, on the margin of lake<span class="pagenum">[Pg 236]</span>
Macquarie deserves especial notice. It was continued
for upwards of fourteen years; during the first six
years at the charges of the London Missionary Society,
but owing to the heavy expense, and the slow progress
of the mission, they withdrew from it after an outlay
of about three thousand pounds. Mr. Threlkeld was
reluctant to give up the mission, and pursued it for
some time from his own resources and those of his
friends, with a small grant of a hundred and fifty pounds
a-year from the British government, who also made
over ten thousand acres of land to be held on trust on
behalf of the natives. Mr. Threlkeld seems to have
been admirably fitted for his work; he had been the
fellow labourer of the martyr John Williams, of
Erromanga, and left the Tahitian mission in consequence
of heavy domestic afflictions. He had spent
much time in acquiring a knowledge of the language
of the &#8220;blacks&#8221; or aborigines, of which he drew
up a grammar, besides translating some portions of
Scripture, Watts&#8217;s hymns, and other suitable works.
He had generally three or four tribes resident around
him upon the land granted for their use. Occasionally
he employed from twelve to sixty of them in burning
off the timber and clearing the land, an employment
which they liked best. At this they would continue
for eight or ten days at a time, until some native
custom, or the report of the hostile intention of some
neighbouring tribe, called them off, perhaps never to
return. Harmless as they seemed, their customs were
ferocious; the tribes were constantly at war, and upon
human life they set no value; they had no law against
murder, and consequently no punishment for it. A
man may murder his wife, or child, or any other
relative with impunity; but if a person murder another<span class="pagenum">[Pg 237]</span>
who is no way connected with him, the nearest of kin to
the murdered person will sometimes avenge his death;
though this seldom happens unless the delinquent and
the sufferer are of different tribes. It is only as they
become acquainted with the customs of Europeans
that human life is regarded. In their native wilds
they sport with the sufferings both of man and beast.</p>

<p>At different periods, Mr. Threlkeld erected huts, but
in these they could not be induced to live, alleging the
accumulation of vermin and the fear of other natives
coming in the night and spearing them without a possibility
of escape. On urging them to plant corn on a
piece of ground he had prepared for them, they replied
it would be useless, as the tribes from the neighbouring
Sugar Loaf Mountain, although on friendly terms,
would come down and take it away when ripe. Mr.
Threlkeld attributed the failure of his mission partly
to the want of funds, but still more to the influx of
European settlers. He deeply deplored the want of
legal protectors, both to prevent the ferocious attacks
of the blacks upon each other, and to protect them
from the white man&#8217;s atrocities. &#8220;I am firmly of
opinion,&#8221; adds Mr. Threlkeld, in the annual report of
his mission for the year 1836, &#8220;that a Protector of
Aborigines will be fully employed in investigating
cases of the cruelty of European settlers, which are
both numerous and shocking to humanity, and in
maintaining their civil rights.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had but too much reason to express himself
thus. The cases of oppression which he himself describes,
are most revolting. In one instance, a stockman,
or herdsman, boasted to his master of having
killed six or seven black men with his own hands,
when in pursuit of them with his companions; for<span class="pagenum">[Pg 238]</span>
they were hunted down in mere wantonness and sport.
He was merely dismissed from his employer&#8217;s service.
In another, a party of stockmen went out, some depredation
having been committed by the blacks in
spearing their cattle, took a black prisoner, tied his
arms, and then fastened him to the stirrup of a stockman
on horseback to drag him along. When the
party arrived near their respective stations they separated,
leaving the stockman to conduct the prisoner to
his own hut. The black, when he found they were alone,
was reluctant to proceed, and struggled to get free,
when the stockman took his knife from his pocket,
coolly stuck the black in the throat, and left him for
dead. The poor fellow crawled to the house of a gentleman
dwelling on the plains, told his tale, and died.</p>

<p>These are but specimens of cruelties, too numerous
and too horrible to relate. The blacks, of course,
retaliated, and military parties were sent out against
them. On the 31st October, 1828, the executive
council of the colony declared in their minutes, &#8220;that
the outrages of the aboriginal natives amount to a
complete declaration of hostilities against the settlers
generally,&#8221; but they forgot to add that these hostilities
had been provoked in every instance by the wanton
aggression of the Europeans. Martial law was again
proclaimed in October, 1830, against the natives, and
the governor at length determined to call upon the
inhabitants to take up arms, and join the troops in
forming a military cordon, by means of which he proposed
to drive the aborigines into Tasman&#8217;s Peninsula.
The inhabitants responded to the call, and an armed
force of between two and three thousand men were in
the field from the 4th October till the 26th November;
but the attempt entirely failed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 239]</span>Mr. Marsden lived to see the beginnings of a better
system, though from his advanced age he was now no
longer able to take an active part in the formation of
new institutions. Before his death, a society had been
formed in the colony for the protection of the aborigines,
and government had also appointed protectors
to defend them against wanton outrage. This was a
great advance in a colony where, Lieutenant Sadleir
(who had the charge of the school at Paramatta for
the aborigines) tells us, that on his first tour up the
country he saw the skull of a celebrated native, in
which was visible the hole where the ball had penetrated
the forehead, placed over a gentleman&#8217;s bookcase
in his sitting-room; &#8220;a trophy,&#8221; he says, &#8220;which
he prized very much, of his success in one of those exterminating
excursions then sometimes undertaken,
when the natives were hunted down like beasts of
prey to be destroyed.&#8221; But it was not till the year
1839 that an act was passed by the legislative council
giving extensive powers to certain &#8220;commissioners of
lands,&#8221; who were also magistrates of the territory, to
put a stop to the atrocities so extensively committed
beyond the boundaries, both by the aborigines and the
European settlers. The governor drew attention to
this act in a proclamation worthy of his high office.
&#8220;As human beings,&#8221; he remarks, &#8220;partaking of our
common nature, as the aboriginal possessors of the
soil from which the wealth of the country has been
principally derived, and as subjects of the queen,
whose authority extends over every part of New Holland,
the natives of the colony have an equal right
with the people of European origin to the protection
and assistance of the law of England.</p>

<p>&#8220;His excellency thinks it right further to inform<span class="pagenum">[Pg 240]</span>
the public that each succeeding despatch from the
secretary of state marks in an increasing degree the
importance which her Majesty&#8217;s government, and no
less the parliament and the people of Great Britain,
attach to the just and humane treatment of the aborigines
of this country, and to declare most earnestly
and solemnly his deep conviction that there is no subject
or matter whatsoever in which the interests as
well as the honour of the colonists are more essentially
concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>His excellency was soon called upon to bring his professions
of impartial justice to the test. A few weeks
only after the date of the proclamation, seven monsters
in human shape, convicts who had been assigned
as stockmen to some of the settlers in the interior,
influenced, it would seem, by no other motive than a
fiendish determination to exterminate the unhappy
natives, set out on horseback in pursuit of their victims.
One Charles Kilmaister was their leader. They
were traced in their progress, inquiring after blacks,
and at last it appeared they arrived at a hut near the
Orawaldo, commonly called the Big River, beyond
Liverpool Plains. Here they discovered a little tribe
of about thirty natives, men, women, and children,
including babes at their mothers&#8217; breasts, assembled
in the bush, unsuspicious of danger, and unconscious
of offence. It was on Sunday. They immediately
approached their victims, who, terrified at their manner,
ran into Kilmaister&#8217;s hut, crying for protection;
but they appealed to hearts of stone. The
bandits having caught them as it were in a trap, dismounted
and followed them into the hut, and, despite
of their entreaties, tied them together with a rope.
When all were thus secured, one end of the rope was<span class="pagenum">[Pg 241]</span>
tied round the body of the foremost of the murderers,
who, having mounted his horse, led the way, dragging
the terrified group after him, while his infamous companions
guarded them on all sides. Onward they
were dragged till a fitting place in the bush was
reached, when the work of slaughter commenced, and
unresisting, these hapless wretches, one after the
other, were brutally butchered. Fathers, and mothers,
and children, fell before the previously sharpened
swords of their executioners, till all lay together a
lifeless mass, clinging to each other even in death,
as with the throes of natural affection. But one shot
was fired, so that it was presumed one only perished
by fire-arms. The precise number thus immolated has
not been accurately ascertained, but it is computed
not less than thirty lay stretched on their own native
soil. The demon butchers then placed the bodies in
a heap, kindled an immense fire over them, and so
endeavoured to destroy the evidence of their unheard-of
brutality. The eye of providence, however, was
not to be thus blinded; and although for a time the
miscreants imagined they had effectually disguised
their horrible work, circumstances led to their apprehension.
Birds of prey were seen hovering about the
spot where the unconsumed remains yet rotted on the
ground. Stockmen in search of their strayed cattle
were attracted to the place, supposing they should
find their carcasses. In this way it was that the ribs,
jaw-bones, half-burned skulls, and other portions of
human skeletons were found, while symptoms of the
conflagration in the vicinity were likewise discovered.
This led to inquiry, and ultimately to the discovery
of the horrible truth. The place was fifty miles from
the nearest police station. The whole of the villains<span class="pagenum">[Pg 242]</span>
were apprehended, and their own admissions and conduct,
both previous and subsequent to the atrocious
deed, added to a chain of circumstantial evidence,
left no doubt of their guilt. It chanced that the
night previous to the murders a heavy rain had fallen,
and traces were thus discovered of horses feet, as well
as of the naked feet of the wretched natives, on the
way to the field of death. The chief witness, a respectable
man, scarce dared, however, to return to the
district, so strong was the sympathy expressed towards
these miscreants, even by persons of influence, some
of whom were magistrates. All possible pains were
taken to save them from condign punishment; subscriptions
were made for their defence, and counsel
retained, but in vain; their guilt was established beyond
a doubt, and Sir George Gipps, the governor,
suffered the law to take its righteous course.</p>

<p>Yet the progress of humanity and righteousness
was very slow, and Mr. Marsden did not live to see
equal justice, not to speak of gospel truth or English
liberty, carried to the aborigines. In the very year
of his death, an effort was made by the attorney-general
of the colony to pass a bill to enable the
courts of justice to receive the evidence of the blacks,
hitherto inadmissible. The chief justice of Australia
gave his sanction to the measure. In laying this bill
before the council, as the law officer of the crown, the
attorney-general gave some painful instances of its
necessity. There was then, he said, lying in his office
a very remarkable case, in which there was no doubt
a considerable number of blacks had been shot, but in
consequence of not being able to take the evidence of
the blacks who witnessed the transaction, it was impossible
to prosecute, although there was proof that<span class="pagenum">[Pg 243]</span>
certain parties went into the bush in a certain direction
with fire-arms, and that shots were heard.
The dead bodies of blacks were afterwards found there,
the skulls of some of them being marked with bullets.
On the other hand five blacks were convicted of a
larceny, and could be convicted of no higher offence,
although those who heard the case must have been
convinced that they had murdered two white men;
but, because the blacks, who knew how the murder
was committed, could not be heard as witnesses, it was
impossible to prosecute them for the murder. The
bill only went so far as to allow the blacks to be
heard,&mdash;&#8220;to allow them to tell their own story; the
jury might believe them or not as their evidence was
corroborated circumstantially, or by other witnesses.&#8221;
Yet this simple instalment of justice was denied, and
the bill was rejected by the legislative council. Such
are some of the crimes through which even England,
just and generous England, has ascended her dazzling
throne of colonial empire. When we tear aside the
veil of national pride, how gloomy are the recesses of
our colonial history; how large the amends which
Britain owes to every native population which God
has intrusted to her care!</p>

<p>Mr. Marsden was now seventy-two years of age.
On every side the friends of his youth were falling,
and he was bowed down with bodily infirmities, the
natural consequence of a life of toil. He often
pointed to an aged tree which grew in sight of his
windows, as an emblem of himself. It had once stood
in the middle of a thick wood, surrounded on all sides
with fine timber; which the waste of years and the
ruthless axe had levelled; now it stood alone, exposed
to every blast, its branches broken off, its trunk<span class="pagenum">[Pg 244]</span>
decayed and its days numbered. Yet he resolved to
pay another, his seventh, and, as it proved, his last
visit to New Zealand. It was thought by his friends,
that he would never live to return. His age and
infirmities seemed to unfit him for any great exertion
of either mind or body; but having formed the resolution,
nothing could now deter him, or divert him
from it. He sailed on the 9th February, 1837, in the
Pyramus, accompanied by his youngest daughter,
and he seemed to be cheered by the reflection that if
he should die upon his voyage he should die in his
harness and upon the battle field on which God had
chosen him to be a leader.</p>

<p>And yet his sturdy spirit scarcely bowed itself to
such misgivings. As on former visits, he had no
sooner landed than his whole soul was invigorated by
scenes from which most others would have shrunk.
He landed on the southern side of the island, at the
river Hokianga, and remained amongst the Wesleyan
missionaries for about a fortnight; after which he
crossed over to the Bay of Islands, carried all the way
in a litter by the natives. In this way he visited the
whole of the missionary stations in the neighbourhood
of the Bay of Islands, as well as Kaitaia, a station at
the North Cape. On the arrival of H. M. S. Rattlesnake,
he accompanied Captain Hobson (afterwards
governor of New Zealand), to the river Thames, and
the East Cape, returning at length to Sydney in that
ship, where he arrived on the 27th of July after an
absence of five months. When entering the heads of
Port Jackson, one of the officers of the ship observed,
&#8220;I think Mr. M. you may look upon this as your last
visit to New Zealand;&#8221; upon which he replied, &#8220;No
I don&#8217;t, for I intend to be off again in about six<span class="pagenum">[Pg 245]</span>
weeks, the people in the colony are becoming too fine
for me now. I am too old to preach before them, but
I can talk to the New Zealanders.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of this, his last visit, we must give some account.
Captain Livesay of the Pyramus, in a valuable
letter to Mr. Nicholas, has given some interesting
reminiscences of his passenger:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;Devonport, November 29, 1837.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash; ... I looked forward to
meeting you with inexpressible delight, to talk about
our much esteemed friend Mr. Marsden, and compare
notes about New Zealand; but we are born to disappointment,
although I shall still look forward to
have that pleasure on my return to England.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the last account I had of Mr. Marsden,
previous to my quitting New Zealand, I was informed
that the trip had done him much good. When he
left the ship, and indeed when I last saw him, which
was a month afterwards, he used to walk with a great
stoop; he was then able to walk upright, and take
considerable exercise. The dear old man! it used to
do my heart good to see his pious zeal in his Master&#8217;s
cause. Nothing ever seemed a trouble to him. He
was always calm and cheerful, even under intense
bodily suffering, which was the case sometimes from
the gravel, which caused him great distress. His
daughter Martha was a very great comfort to him; she
was constantly with him, and very affectionate in her
attentions. I did hope my next voyage would have
been to New South Wales, that I might have the
pleasure of seeing him once more, should God have
spared him so long; but that thought must now be
given up.&#8221; ...</p></blockquote>

<p>The remainder of the letter has reference to the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 246]</span>
state and prospects of New Zealand. The sentiments
are honourable to a British sailor. How happy it
would have been for the Maori race, had all English
captains who visited the Bay of Islands, been such
men as Captain Livesay!</p>

<p>He says, &#8220;It affords me great satisfaction to
find that a committee are forming for the colonization of
New Zealand, on the scale you intimate. It is very
much to be desired indeed; as the poor natives are
becoming a prey and a sacrifice to a set of dissolute
wretches who do all in their power to sink the savage
into the perfect brute, or by design and craft to cheat
them out of all their possessions. Even those who
call themselves respectable, are amongst this number,
and one or two, to my certain knowledge, have
purchased an immense extent of land for a mere song,
depriving the rising generation of all their claims.
The New Zealanders are upon the whole, a fine and
intelligent race, capable of much if well directed.
They are accused of low cunning, and covetousness in
their dealings with the Europeans. Let the question
be asked, who taught them to be so? Why, the
Europeans themselves. They are said to be ferocious.
I maintain that they are not half so much so as our
own ancestors in the barbarous times of Britain; and
where Christianity has been properly introduced, they
are quite a different race of beings. Let but the ill
weeds that have taken root there be torn up, and the
wholesome plant of industry and sobriety, with the
spirit of the gospel, sown in its place, and all the
savage will soon cease to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;ill weeds&#8221; were springing up apace, and, as a
consequence, the missionary cause was once more in
peril.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 247]</span>An English barque had lately been wrecked upon
the coast, but fortunately Mr. Guard the captain, his
wife, two children, and the crew, twenty-eight in all,
escaped to land. At first, according to the statement
of the captain, the natives treated them with kindness,
which they soon exchanged, under what pretext, or in
consequence of what provocations on either side, it
would be useless to ask, for open hostilities. A
quarrel was got up between two native tribes, and an
engagement followed, in which twelve Europeans, and
about forty Maories fell. Guard and his party were
taken prisoners. It shows how great an improvement
had taken place amongst the natives, that they were
not massacred and devoured; but, on condition of
returning with a cask of powder as a ransom for
himself and the rest, Guard and five of his men were
allowed to proceed, without further molestation, to
Sydney; where he laid the matter before Sir Richard
Bourke the governor. Relying on the accuracy of
Guard&#8217;s narrative, the governor, with the advice of the
executive council, requested Captain Lambert to
proceed with H.M.S. Alligator, which happened to
be lying in Port Jackson, to obtain the restoration of
the British subjects, then in the hands of the New
Zealanders. He was instructed to abstain from any
act of retaliation, and to obtain the restoration of the
captives by amicable means; and Guard and his five
men returned in the same ship.</p>

<p>Soon after the arrival of the party at New Zealand,
Guard recognised the chief who was now the proprietor
of the shipwrecked woman and children; and
the unsuspicious native rubbed noses with him in
token of amity, at the same time expressing his
readiness to give up his prisoners on receiving the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 248]</span>
&#8220;payment&#8221; guaranteed to him. This, however was
not the way in which the affair was to be settled;
Guard and his sailors seized him as a prisoner, and
dragged him into the whale boat in which the party
had gone ashore. The cruelty practised towards this
unfortunate man, and the fearful havoc committed by
the English, we gladly pass over. Such iniquitous
transactions reflect but little credit on us as a Christian
or a civilized people; and they were, moreover, in
direct opposition to the benevolent instructions of
Sir Richard Bourke. The British subjects were
restored; as indeed they might have been without the
loss of a single life, through the intervention of the
missionaries, and of the British resident at the Bay
of Islands, and the expedition having gained its object
by force and stratagem, returned to Sydney with the
troops and the liberated captives.</p>

<p>This painful affair, as well as other acts of outrage,
on the part of the natives, which were its natural consequence,
made a deep impression at the time, and
were a source of great uneasiness to Mr. Marsden.
He saw at once the danger to which they exposed the
missionaries and their cause, and felt, no doubt, a just
reliance on himself. Unarmed and unprotected, had
he been upon the spot, he would have accomplished more
in his own person than all those warlike measures had
effected, which anew embittered the Maori race against
the Europeans.</p>

<p>His record of his farewell visit was probably not
kept with his former accuracy; but the chasm is well
supplied by the interesting journal of his daughter,
some extracts from which the reader will peruse with
pleasure. We have the whole scene placed before us
by her graceful pen, and we gain some glimpse into<span class="pagenum">[Pg 249]</span>
her father&#8217;s character, which we should certainly not
have gathered from his own modest, self-forgetting,
memoranda.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;<i>February 12, Sunday.</i>&mdash;Had service on deck. The
Rev. Mr. Wilkinson read prayers, and my father
preached. The sailors were very attentive; the service
was truly interesting from its novelty and the impressiveness
of the scene; nothing around us but the wide
waste of waters.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>13th.</i>&mdash;At the suggestion of Captain L&mdash;&mdash;,
reading in the evenings was introduced. We began
the History of Columbus, by Washington Irving, and
the arrangement is that we are to read by turns.&#8221;</p>

<p>The weather proved boisterous, and it was not
before the 21st they made the land.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>22nd.</i>&mdash;Up early on deck to view the land, which
presented a very bold and romantic appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not being able to obtain a pilot, the captain determined,
lest he should lose the tide, Hokianga being
a bar harbour, to take the vessel in himself. The dead
lights were put in, and every arrangement made as we
approached the bar. Not a voice was heard but that of
the captain and the two men in the chains, heaving
the lead. Every sailor was at his station, and the anchors
in readiness to let go at a moment&#8217;s warning.
We sounded as shallow as &#8216;a quarter less four,&#8217; when
the ladies became alarmed, though we were obliged to
keep our fears to ourselves, as the gentlemen very
politely left us. The wind being light, the fear was
the breakers would have overtaken the ship, thrown
her upon her beam ends, and rendered her unmanageable;
but providence guided and preserved us.</p>

<p>&#8220;I seldom remember a more beautiful scene; the
moon is near its full, and the banks of the river are<span class="pagenum">[Pg 250]</span>
very high, covered with the most luxuriant foliage.
We were so delighted with the scenery that we would
willingly have stayed up all night. As we proceeded
up, the mountains appeared to lessen into hills.
Several native hamlets, and two or three residences of
Europeans, show that the busy hand of man has been
engaged in the work of redeeming the wilderness from
the wild dominion of nature. Anchored near the
Wesleyan mission station, where we were kindly welcomed
by Mr. and Mrs. Turner. The mission here
has been established nearly nine years; they have a
neat chapel and one or two comfortable houses, and
are about to form an additional station. The missionaries
related several instances of the melancholy
death of various New Zealanders who have opposed
the progress of the mission. One chief became so incensed
against the &#8216;Atua,&#8217; for the death of his child,
that he formed a circle of gunpowder, placed himself
in the centre, and fired it. The explosion did not immediately
destroy him; he lingered a few weeks in
dreadful agony, and then died.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;The natives are coming in great numbers
to attend divine worship. Mr. Turner preached,
and afterwards my father addressed them. They
listened with earnest attention, and were much pleased.
Many of the old chiefs were delighted to see my father,
and offered to build him a house, if he would remain.
One said, &#8216;Stay with us and learn our language, and
then you will become our father and our friend, and
we will build you a house.&#8217; &#8216;No,&#8217; replied another, &#8216;we
cannot build a house good enough, but we will hire
Europeans to do it for us.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole congregation joined in the responses
and singing, and though they have not the most<span class="pagenum">[Pg 251]</span>
pleasing voices, yet it was delightful to hear them
sing one of the hymns commencing &#8216;From Egypt
lately come.&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The journey across from Hokianga to the Waimat,
as described by Miss Martha Marsden, shows, in the
absence of railroads and steam carriages, an agreeable
if not expeditious mode of conveyance. &#8220;Took leave
of Mrs. Turner; and, mounted in a chair on the
shoulders of two New Zealanders, I headed the procession.
My father, Mr. Wilkinson, and the two
children, were carried in &#8216;kaw-shores,&#8217; or native biers,
on which they carry their sick. We entered a forest
of five miles, then stopped to dine. The natives soon
cooked their potatoes, corn, etc., in their ovens, which
they scoop in the sand, and after heating a number of
stones, the potatoes are put in, covered with grass and
leaves, and a quantity of water poured upon them;
they were exquisitely steamed. As I approached one
of the groups sitting at dinner, I was much affected
by seeing one of them get up and ask a blessing over
the basket of potatoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Five miles from Waimat I left my chair, mounted
on horseback, and reached Waimat for breakfast.
Old Nini accompanied us the whole way, and told my
father if he attempted to ride he would leave him.
The natives carried him the whole way with the
greatest cheerfulness, and brought him through the
most difficult places with the greatest ease. The
distance they carried him was about twenty miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>The state of all the missions with regard to their
spiritual work was now full of hope. Of the Wesleyan
mission Mr. Marsden himself reports, &#8220;I found that
many were inquiring after the Saviour, and that a
large number attended public worship. The prospect<span class="pagenum">[Pg 252]</span>
of success to the Church of England Mission is very
great. Since my arrival at the missionary station I
have not heard one oath spoken by European or
native; the schools and church are well attended, and
the greatest order is observed among all classes. I
met with many wherever I went, who were anxious
after the knowledge of God. Wherever I went I
found some who could read and write. They are all
fond of reading, and there are many who never had an
opportunity of attending the schools who, nevertheless,
can read. They teach one another in all parts of the
country, from the North to the East Cape.&#8221;</p>

<p>The native tribes were still at war with each other,
and with the European settlers&mdash;the miserable effect
of Captain Guard&#8217;s rash conduct. From the missionary
station at Pahia Mr. Marsden&#8217;s daughter counted
one morning twenty-one canoes passing up the bay.
A battle followed, which she witnessed at a distance,
and the Europeans all around fled to the missionary
station. In the engagement three chiefs fell; a
second fight occurred soon afterwards. &#8220;We have
heard firing all day,&#8221; she writes; &#8220;many have been
killed; we saw the canoes pass down the river containing
the bodies of the slain.&#8221; Mr. Marsden himself
was absent on a visit to the southward, or his presence
might possibly have prevented these scenes of blood.</p>

<p>Wherever the venerable man appeared, he was
received by the converted natives with Christian
salutations and tears of joy; the heathen population
welcomed him with the firing of muskets and their
rude war dances. Wherever he went, he was greeted
with acclamations as the friend and father of the New
Zealanders. One chieftain sat down upon the ground
before him gazing upon him in silence, without moving<span class="pagenum">[Pg 253]</span>
a limb or uttering a single word for several hours.
He was gently reproved by Mr. Williams for what
seemed a rudeness. &#8220;Let me alone,&#8221; said he, &#8220;let
me take a last look; I shall never see him again.&#8221;
&#8220;One principal chief,&#8221; writes Mr. Marsden, &#8220;who
had embraced the gospel and been baptized, accompanied
us all the way. We had to travel about
forty miles, by land and water. He told me he was so
unhappy at Hokianga that he could not get to
converse with me from the crowds that attended, and
that he had come to Waimat to speak with me. I
found him to be a very intelligent man, and anxious
to know the way to heaven.&#8221; While at Kaitai he
held a constant leve, sitting in an arm-chair, in an
open field, before the mission house; it was attended
by upwards of a thousand Maories, who poured in
from every quarter; many coming a distance of twenty
or thirty miles, contented to sit down and gaze on his
venerable features; and so they continued to come
and go till his departure. With his characteristic
kindness and good nature he presented each with a
pipe and fig of tobacco; and when he was to embark
at last, they carried him to the ship, a distance of six
miles.</p>

<p>Before leaving New Zealand, he wrote to the Church
Missionary Society an account which glows with pious
exultation, describing the success with which the Head
of the church had at length been pleased to bless the
labours of his faithful servants. Since his arrival, he
says, he had visited many of the stations within the
compass of a hundred miles. It was his intention to
have visited all of them, from the North to the East
Cape; but from the disturbed state of the country
&#8220;it was not considered prudent for him to go to the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 254]</span>
south,&#8221; where he still contemplated further efforts
&#8220;when the country should be more settled in its
political affairs.&#8221; He had &#8220;observed a wonderful
change: those portions of the sacred Scriptures which
had been printed have had a most astonishing effect;
they are read by the natives in every place where I
have been; the natives teach one another, and find
great pleasure in the word of God, and carry that
sacred treasure with them wherever they go. Great
numbers have been baptized, both chiefs and their
people.&#8221; He had met with some very pious chiefs,
who had refused to share in the present war, and
avowed their resolution to fight no more. One of
them, at his own cost, had built a chapel, or place of
public worship, which was visited by the missionaries;
in this he himself taught a school, assisted by his son.
&#8220;Waimat, once the most warlike district in the
island, is now,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the most orderly and
moral place I was ever in. My own mind has been
exceedingly gratified by what I have seen and heard.&#8221;
Old age, it seems, is not always querulous; its
retrospects are not always in favour of the past; the
aged Christian walks with a more elastic step as he
sees the fruit of his labour, and anticipates his own
great reward. &#8220;Mine eyes,&#8221; he concludes, &#8220;are
dim with age like Isaac&#8217;s; it is with some difficulty I
can see to write.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nor had the weakness and credulity of advancing
years led him to take for granted, as in second childhood
old age is wont to do, the truth of first impressions,
or the accuracy of every man&#8217;s reports. He
still gave to every subject connected with missions the
closest attention, penetrated beneath the surface, and
formed his own conclusions. While in New Zealand,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 255]</span>
for instance, he addresses the following queries to Mr.
Matthews, one of the missionaries, on the subject of
education:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">&#8220;April, 1837.</p>

<p>&#8220;... I will thank you to return me what number
of native young men there are employed from your
station on the sabbath in visiting the natives, I mean
the numbers who occasionally visit their countrymen
and instruct them. What schools there are at the
station, and who are the teachers? Have you an
infant school, or a school for men and boys? a school
for women? What do they learn? Do they learn to
read and write? Do they understand figures? Have
they renounced generally their former superstitions?
At what period of the day do they attend school?
Have they any meeting in the week-days for prayer
and religious instruction? Do they appear to have
any views of the Lord Jesus Christ as a Saviour? Any
information you can give me, along with your brethren,
will be very acceptable to the lovers of the gospel in
New South Wales.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quotsig">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Samuel Marsden</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On one point only he met with no success. He had
not yet quite abandoned the pleasing dream of a
Maori nation, united under one chief; a Christian
people, governed by a code of native law. Tahiti
naturally encouraged these bright visions, and seemed
to show how easily they might be realized. There,
for ten years past, under king Pomare, the wondrous
spectacle had been presented to the world of a whole
people, under the guidance of their king, rejecting
idolatry, and with it all the base usages of savage life,
and working out their own national regeneration;
framing a Tahitian code of law on the sound principles
of Christian jurisprudence, and cordially adopting it.
Why should not a similar state of things be brought<span class="pagenum">[Pg 256]</span>
about in New Zealand? The instrumental agency in
both islands was the same; namely, that of Christian
missionaries, chiefly, if not entirely, English Christians,
who carried with them, it might be supposed, to both
islands the same reverence for order, and with it the
same love of liberty. Were the Maories an inferior
race, compared with the aborigines of the Tahitian
group? On the contrary, the difference was rather
in favour of the Maori; he was the more athletic, and
consequently the more vigorous in his mental development;
indeed, upon the whole, he stands unapproached
by any other tribe of man uncivilized and in a state of
nature; unless we go back to the heroic ages and find
his equal amongst ancient Greeks at the dawning of
their somewhat fabulous history.</p>

<p>Yet the project failed; and Mr. Marsden was now
obliged mournfully to admit that New Zealand&#8217;s only
hope lay in her annexation to the British crown. The
two causes of the failure of these otherwise reasonable
expectations are to be found, no doubt, first, in the
circumstances of the Maori tribes, and secondly, in the
pernicious effects produced by European traders and
settlers.</p>

<p>Tahiti was happy in possessing one sovereign. New
Zealand was unfortunate in its multitude of petty
chieftains. When the heart of king Pomare was
gained, the confidence of a loyal and devoted people
was at once won over. There was no rival to foment
rebellion, or to seize the occasion of a religious festival,
when he and his people were unarmed, to make inroads
on his territory. With the assistance of his council,
and under the advice of the faithful missonaries, a
code of law was easily prepared, suited for all his subjects,
and adapted to every part of his little kingdom.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 257]</span>
In New Zealand, on the contrary, the chiefs, each of
whom claimed to be perfectly independent of the rest,
were constantly at enmity with each other. The
violent passions of civil war never slept&mdash;hatred, revenge,
and jealousy. The missionaries, if cherished by
Shunghie, were hated or feared by Shunghie&#8217;s opponent.
Their direct influence in the politics of the
Maories was therefore, of necessity, slight. But the
chief hindrance arose from the mutual animosities of the
chiefs, and the want of confidence in each other which
universally prevailed, both among chiefs and people.</p>

<p>And it must be confessed with sorrow, that the evil
example of the Europeans provoked the natives to
fresh crimes, and indisposed them to all the restraints
of civil government. The Polynesian Islands had, up
to this period, known neither commerce nor colonization.
Except a chance visit from a man-of-war, a
European ship was scarcely ever seen; or the few
which came and went were connected with the missions,
and were manned by decent if not religious
crews. The polluting influence of a debauched and
drunken body of seamen, rolling in constant succession
to its shores, had not yet tainted the moral atmosphere
of Tahiti and its neighbouring group. And
colonization had not even been attempted; the natives
were left in full possession of their soil, no man making
them afraid. In New Zealand all this was reversed.
Wicked seamen infected even savages with new vices;
and lawless settlers set an example of injustice, shocking
even to New Zealanders. For these evils it was
evident there was but one remedy, the strong hand of
British rule. Take the following sketch from the pen
of Mr. Marsden. After describing the happy state of
the Christian settlement at Waimat, he goes on to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 258]</span>
say: &#8220;On the opposite side of the harbour, a number
of Europeans have settled along with the natives.
Several keep public-houses, and encourage every kind
of crime. Here drunkenness, adultery, murder, etc.
are committed. There are no laws, judges, nor magistrates;
so that Satan maintains his dominion without
molestation. Some civilized government must take
New Zealand under its protection, or the most dreadful
evils will be committed by runaway convicts, sailors
and publicans. There are no laws here to punish
crimes. When I return to New South Wales, I purpose
to lay the state of New Zealand before the colonial
government, to see if anything can be done to
remedy these public evils.&#8221; &#8220;I hope in time,&#8221; he
says again, in a letter, dated May 16th, 1837, from
Pahaia, to the Rev. James Matthews, &#8220;the chiefs will
get a governor. I shall inform the Europeans in
authority how much they are distressed in New Zealand
for want of a governor with power to punish
crime. The Bay of Islands is now in a dreadful state.... It
is my intention to return to New South
Wales by the first opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>That opportunity soon appeared, and the venerable
founder of its missions, the advocate of its native
population, the friend of all that concerned its present
or spiritual welfare, took his last leave of the shores of
New Zealand. Preparations were made for his reception
on board H. M. S. Rattlesnake. The signal
gun was fired, and all the friends from Waimat and
Keri-Keri arrived to accompany their revered father
to the beach, &#8220;Where,&#8221; says one of them who was
present, &#8220;like Paul at Miletus, we parted with many
benedictions: sorrowing most of all that we should
see his face again no more. Many could not bid him
adieu. The parting was with many tears.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 259]</span>His happy temperament always diffused pleasure
and conciliated friendship. On board the Rattlesnake
he was welcomed with warm, affectionate,
respect. Captain Hobson, who was afterwards for a
time governor of New Zealand, knew his worth, and
felt honoured by his company; and Mr. Marsden fully
appreciated the high character and courtesy of the
commander, whose widow retains a handsome piece of
plate presented to her husband by his grateful passenger,
as a memorial of the happiness he enjoyed on
this his last voyage homewards.</p>

<p>The chaplain of the Rattlesnake noted down an
affecting conversation with the aged minister upon his
voyage, which we are permitted to insert:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We enjoyed a most lovely evening. I had a long
conversation with Mr. Marsden on deck. He spoke of
almost all his old friends having preceded him to the
eternal world; Romaine, Newton, the Milners, Scott,
Atkinson, Robinson, Buchanan, Mason Good, Thomason,
Rowland Hill, Legh Richmond, Simeon, and
others. He then alluded in a very touching manner
to his late wife; they had passed, he observed, more
than forty years of their pilgrimage through this
wilderness in company, and he felt their separation
the more severely as the months rolled on. I remarked
that their separation would be but for a short period
longer. &#8216;God grant it,&#8217; was his reply; then lifting
his eyes towards the moon, which was peacefully
shedding her beams on the sails of our gallant bark,
he exclaimed with intense feeling.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Marsden&#8217;s ministerial pursuits and journeys&mdash;Love of the Country
and of Patriarchal story&mdash;His Old Age&mdash;Its mental features&mdash;Anecdotes&mdash;Love
of Children&mdash;Bishop Broughton&mdash;His reverence
for Mr. Marsden&#8217;s character&mdash;Mr. Marsden&#8217;s views of Death, etc.&mdash;His
Habits of Prayer&mdash;His Illness and Death.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Marsden had now passed the allotted span of
human life, though his days were not yet &#8220;labour and
sorrow.&#8221; Entering upon his seventy-second year with
stooping gait and failing eyesight and a decaying
memory, he had otherwise few of the mental infirmities
of age. He was still a perfect stranger to fear, as well
as to that nervous restlessness and susceptibility which
wears the appearance of it, though often found, as
may be daily observed, in connexion with the truest
courage. After his return home from his last voyage
he was attacked, when driving with his youngest
daughter, upon one of his excursions in the bush, by
two famous bush rangers Wormley and Webber, part
of a gang who for a period of two years kept the whole
country in a state of terror. One of the ruffians
presented a loaded pistol at his breast and another at
his daughter&#8217;s, threatening with horrid imprecations to
shoot them both, if they said a word, and bidding his
daughter to empty her father&#8217;s pockets into their
hands. Perfectly undismayed, Mr. Marsden remonstrated
with them on their wicked course of life, telling
them at last that he should soon see them again,
he had no doubt, on the gallows. At parting, though
charged, with the usual threats, not to look behind him,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 261]</span>
he turned round, and continued, while they were in
sight, to warn them in the same strain of the certain
consequences of a life of crime. His admonition was
soon verified; the wretched men were apprehended for
other outrages and sentenced to death, and he himself
attended them from the condemned cell to the place
of execution.</p>

<p>These excursions into the country around Paramatta,
where he had gone about for a period of nearly
forty years doing the work of an evangelist or home
missionary, were continued to the last. To wind
through devious paths in the bush in his one horse
chaise, where his good horse <i>Major</i> seemed as if trained
to penetrate, gave him the highest pleasure. The way
was often trackless, and he was obliged to ask his
companion whether the trace of a cartwheel could be
seen. Yet there was an instinctive feeling of safety
in his company, and a refreshment in his conversation,
which always made the vacant seat in the gig prized
by those who knew and loved him. &#8220;As he drove
along,&#8221; says a Christian lady, the wife of Captain B&mdash;&mdash;
who was his companion on some of his last journeys,
&#8220;wherever he went there was always to be found
some testimony to that goodness and mercy which had
followed him all the days of his life. Some Ebenezer
he could raise where helped perhaps in an encounter
with a bushranger, having only the sword of the Spirit
with which to defend himself and disarm his foe, or
some Bethel, it might be, where like Jacob he had
been enabled to wrestle and prevail. With such a
companion no one could be a loser. On these excursions,
no matter to what distance, he seemed to
think preparations needless, he would travel miles and
miles without any previous consideration for his own<span class="pagenum">[Pg 262]</span>
comfort or convenience. Even a carpet-bag was an
encumbrance. He had been too long accustomed to
make his toilet with the New Zealander, and take with
him his meal of fern-root, to be particular, or to take
thought, what he should eat, or wherewithal should he
be clothed.&#8221;</p>

<p>His love of the country and of rural scenes gave a
strong colouring, and great originality to his preaching
as well as to his own religious character. He
called his estate &#8220;The plains of Mamre.&#8221; This property
we may remind the reader had been presented
to Mr. Marsden in the early days of the colony, when
land uncleared was absolutely worthless, to eke out his
insufficient stipend. It had now become valuable, and
he was exposed both in the colony and in England to
many unjust remarks, even from those who should have
known him better, on the score of his reputed wealth.
His own justification of himself is more than sufficient.
Being told that he was charged with avarice, &#8220;Why,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;they might as well find fault with Abraham
whose flocks and herds multiplied. Abraham never
took any trouble about it, nor do I. I can&#8217;t help their
increasing;&#8221; and he added, a remark so true and of
such pregnant import that it ought for ever to have
put to silence this miserable carping; &#8220;It was not
for myself, but for the benefit of this colony and New
Zealand, that I ever tried to promote agriculture or
the improvement in sheep or cattle.&#8221; Had he done
nothing else for Australia, his introduction of Merino
sheep with a view to the growth of wool would have
marked him down upon the roll of her greatest benefactors.</p>

<p>Through life his choicest topics in the pulpit
had been the patriarchs, their lives and characters<span class="pagenum">[Pg 263]</span>
but as he grew old, he seemed unconsciously to rank
amongst their number; to fall into and become one of
their own body; himself a Christian patriarch. It
was the frequent remark of his friends that he spoke
of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, just as if he had lived
in their times, heard their conversations, and been well
acquainted with them. It is much to be regretted
that more full and accurate reports of his sermons
and conversations should not have been kept. The
truth and originality of his remarks would have made
them invaluable. When seated in his chair upon the
lawn before his house, surrounded by his family and
friends, his conversations took the prevailing turn of
his mind, and he used to dwell on the incidents of
patriarchal life with a depth of feeling and a power of
picturesque description of which one would be glad that
the memorials should not have been allowed to perish.</p>

<p>At an examination of the King&#8217;s School at Sydney,
the headmaster having requested him to ask the boys
some questions upon Scripture history, forgetting the
business in hand, he broke out into a long and interesting
address on patriarchal life and manners. The end
contemplated by the headmaster was of course frustrated,
&#8220;but we dare say,&#8221; says the colonial journalist
who tells the story, &#8220;there are many young persons
now growing up into manhood, who, to this day remember
the pious and excellent observations of the
venerable man.&#8221;</p>

<p>His old age exhibited some traits not always to be
found, even in good men, after a long life passed
among scenes of danger or amidst the hardening warfare
of personal animosities. Though to the last bold
in reproving sin his real character was that of gentleness
and the warmest social affection. None but the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 264]</span>
bad were ever afraid of him; on the contrary, his
presence diffused a genial light and warmth in every
company. Cruel savages and little children loved him
alike; the wisest men gathered instruction from his
lips, while they found pleasure in his simple courtesy
and manly open heartedness. He brought home with
him in the Rattlesnake from New Zealand, several
Maori youths; &#8220;they seemed to love and respect their
<i>Matua</i>, as they called him, more than any one, or anything,
besides. They used to run after his gig like
joyous children, and to attempt to catch his eye as if to
bask in the sunshine of his benevolent countenance.&#8221;
&#8220;They delighted;&#8221; says Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;, to whose manuscript
of Mr. Marsden&#8217;s last years of life we are again indebted,
&#8220;to come to our barrack apartments with him,
always making their way to the bookcase first, take
out a book and point upwards, as if everybody who
had anything to do with &#8216;Matua&#8217; must have all their
books leading to heaven. Pictures pleased them next;
when they would direct each others&#8217; attention to
what they considered worthy of notice, with extraordinary
intelligence; but when the boiled rice and
sweets made their appearance, digging their elbows
into each others&#8217; sides, with gesticulations of all sorts,
and knowing looks, putting their fingers to their
mouths, and laughing with greedy joy, Mr. Marsden all
the time watching their movements, and expressive
faces, as a kind nurse would the gambols and frolics of
her playful charge, saying with restrained, but grateful
emotion, &#8216;Yes, sir, nothing like bringing the gospel
at once to the heathen. If &#8220;music charms the savage
breast,&#8221; sir, why should not the sweetest sounds that
ever met man&#8217;s ear do more? Why, sir, the gospel
turns a worse than savage into a man, ay, and into a<span class="pagenum">[Pg 265]</span>
woman too.&#8217; He then related to us the anecdote of
a New Zealand woman who, for the last remaining
years of her life preached the gospel among her own
sex, having acknowledged to him, that before he had
brought the word of God to New Zealand, and the
Spirit applied it to her heart, she had killed and eaten
nineteen children.&#8221;</p>

<p>His last communication to the Church Missionary
Society, dated December 10th, 1837, and received after
his death, is full of hope for his beloved New Zealanders.
&#8220;I am happy to say the mission goes on well amidst
every difficulty. I visited many places in my last
voyage from the North Cape to Cloudy Bay. The
gospel has made a deep impression upon many of the
natives, who now lead godly lives.&#8221; The letter, which
is written in a large and straggling hand, as though
the pen were no longer under its usual firm control,
concludes with these touching words: &#8220;I am now
very feeble. My eyes are dim, and my memory fails
me. I have done no duty on the sabbath for some
weeks through weakness. When I review all the
way the Lord has led me through this wilderness I am
constrained to say, <i>Bless the Lord, O my soul, etc</i>,</p>

<p class="quotsig">&#8220;Yours very affectionately,<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Samuel Marsden</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The innocent games of children pleased him to the
last. When such meetings were more rare than they
have now become, the children of the Paramatta school
once a year assembled on his lawn, and then his happiness
was almost equal to their own. In his own
family, and amongst the children of his friends, he
would even take his share in their youthful gambols,
and join the merry party at blind man&#8217;s buff. Though,
as he said of himself, he &#8220;never sang a song in his<span class="pagenum">[Pg 266]</span>
life, for he learned to sing hymns when ten years old,
and never sang anything else,&#8221; yet he was charmed
with the sweet and hearty voices of children joining in
some innocent little song, and it pleased him better
still if it finished off with a noisy chorus. Yet all this
was consistent with his character as a grave, wise old
man. Though mirthful, he was never frivolous; in a
moment, if occasion called for it, he was ready to
discuss the most serious subjects, or to give his opinion
upon matters of importance; and he had the enviable
talent of mingling even pious conversation with the
sports of children.</p>

<p>It was observed that though always unembarrassed
in the presence of strangers whatever their rank or
importance might be, he never seemed completely
happy but in the company of persons of true piety.
He does not appear to have spoken very freely in
ordinary society on the subject of personal religion,
still less on the subject of his own experience; but his
emotions were deep, and out of the fulness of the heart
his lips would speak, in the midst of such a circle, of
the loving-kindness of the Lord. The sense of his
own unworthiness seems to have been always present.
Of all God&#8217;s servants he might have been, as he verily
thought himself to be, the most unprofitable; and
when any circumstance occurred which led him to
contrast the justice of God to others who were left to
die impenitent, with the mercy shown to himself, he
spoke with a humiliation deeply affecting. With
scenes of vice and human depravity few living men
were more conversant than he, yet to the last such
was the delicacy of his conscience that the presence of
vice shocked him as much as if the sight were new.
&#8220;Riding down to the barracks one morning,&#8221; says the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 267]</span>
lady whose narrative we have already quoted, &#8220;to
invite Captain B&mdash;&mdash; and myself that day to dinner
to meet the bishop, he had passed what, alas! used to
be too frequent an object, a man lying insensible and
intoxicated in the road. His usually cheerful countenance
was saddened, and after telling us his errand,
we could not but ask the cause of his distress. He
gave us the unhappy cause, and turning his horse&#8217;s
head round to leave us, he uttered with deep emotion&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 28em;">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Why was I made to hear thy voice</span>
<span class="i0">And enter while there&#8217;s room?&#8217;</span>
</div>

<p>Throughout the day the subject dwelt upon his mind;
after dinner the conversation turned to it, and he was
casually asked who was the author of the hymn he had
quoted in the morning. He shook his head and said,
&#8216;I cannot tell, perhaps it was Watts, or Wesley,&#8217;
and several hymn books were produced in which the
bishop and others instituted a fruitless search, the
bishop at length saying, &#8216;I can&#8217;t find the hymn, Mr.
Marsden.&#8217; &#8216;Can&#8217;t you, sir,&#8217; was the reply, &#8216;that is
a pity, for it is a good hymn, sir&mdash;says what the Bible
says, free sovereign grace for poor sinners. No self-righteous
man can get into heaven, sir, he would rather
starve than take the free gift.&#8217; In the course of the
day the conversation turning upon New Zealand, the
bishop expressed the opinion, once almost universal
though now happily exploded, an opinion, too, which Mr.
Marsden himself had regarded with some favour in his
younger days, that civilization must precede the introduction
of the gospel; and his lordship argued, as
Mr. Marsden himself had argued thirty years before,
in favour of expanding the mind of savages by the
introduction of arts and sciences, being impressed with
the idea that it was impossible to present the gospel<span class="pagenum">[Pg 268]</span>
with success to minds wholly unenlightened. Mr.
Marsden&#8217;s answer is thus recorded&mdash;&#8216;Civilization is
not necessary before Christianity, sir; do both together
if you will, but you will find civilization follow
Christianity, easier than Christianity to follow civilization.
Tell a poor heathen of his true God and
Saviour, point him to the works he can see with his
own eyes, for these heathen are no fools, sir&mdash;great
mistake to send illiterate men to them&mdash;they don&#8217;t
want men learned after the fashion of this world, but
men taught in the spirit and letter of the Scripture.
I shan&#8217;t live to see it, sir, but I may hear of it in
heaven, that New Zealand with all its cannibalism and
idolatry will yet set an example of Christianity to
some of the nations now before her in civilization.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>It will not be out of place to offer a passing remark
upon Mr. Marsden&#8217;s conduct to Dr. Broughton, the
first bishop of Sydney. As an Episcopalian, sincerely
attached to the church of England, he had long desired
the introduction of the episcopate into the colonial
church, of which, as senior chaplain, he himself had
been the acknowledged leader for so many years.
When the appointment was made it was a matter of
just surprise to his friends that he was passed over
in silence, while an English clergyman was placed
over him to govern the clergy, amongst whom he had
so long presided, and whose entire respect and confidence
he had gained. There is no doubt that his
integrity and fearless honesty had rendered him somewhat
unacceptable to men in power, and that to this
his exclusion is, in a great measure, to be ascribed.
But this slight brought out some of the finest features
in his truly noble character. He had never sought
either honours, wealth, or preferment for himself. If<span class="pagenum">[Pg 269]</span>
a disinterested man ever lived it was Samuel Marsden.
The only remark which his family remember to have
heard him make upon the subject was in answer to a
friend, who had expressed surprise at the slight thus
put upon him, in these words&mdash;&#8220;It is better as it is;
I am an old man; my work is almost done.&#8221; And
when Dr. Broughton, the new bishop, arrived in the
colony, he was received by Mr. Marsden not with cold
and formal respect but with Christian cordiality.
When the new bishop was installed he assisted at the
solemn service; the eloquent author of the &#8220;Prisoners
of Australia,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> who chanced to be present, thus
describes the scene&mdash;&#8220;On a more touching sight mine
eyes had never looked than when the aged man, tears
streaming down his venerable cheek, poured forth,
amidst a crowded and yet silent assemblage, the
benediction upon him into whose hands he had thus,
as it were, to use his own metaphor, &#8216;yielded up the
keys of a most precious charge;&#8217; a charge which had
been his own devoted care throughout the storms and
the tempests of a long and difficult pilotage. And now
like another Simeon, his work well nigh accomplished,
the gospel spreading far and wide over the colony and
its dependencies, and the prayer of his adopted people
answered, he could say without another wish, &#8216;Lord,
now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine
eyes have seen thy salvation.&#8217;&#8221; Though differing from
him, we may add, on some points, Mr. Marsden retained
to the last sincere regard for bishop Broughton, who
in return fully appreciated the high and lofty character
of his senior chaplain. &#8220;Well!&#8221; said he one day when
he heard of his last illness, breaking out after a thoughtful
silence, &#8220;if there ever was a truly honest man,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 270]</span>Mr. Marsden certainly is one;&#8221; and after his death he
publicly expressed his &#8220;deep sense of the loss he had
experienced, and the painful void he felt in the absence
of his aged and faithful companion who had so often
stood by his side, whose genuine piety and natural
force of understanding,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I held in the highest
esteem while he lived, and still retain them in sincerely
affectionate remembrance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Conscious that in the course of nature his decease
could not be far distant, death was now his frequent
meditation. He viewed its approach without levity
and without alarm. Familiar through life with death
in every form, his feelings were not blunted; he still
felt it was a solemn thing to die, but he had experienced
the love of Him who had tasted death for
every man, and was no longer &#8220;subject to bondage
through fear of death.&#8221; He continued his pastoral
visits to the sick and dying to the last, and some of those
who were raised from a bed of languishing, and who
survived their pastor, speak of the affectionate kindness,
the delicacy and tenderness, as well as the deep-toned
spirituality of mind he showed in the sick chamber,
as something which those who had not witnessed it
would be backward to credit. One of the last letters
which he penned filled three sides of folio paper, addressed
to a friend who had met with a severe accident
in being thrown from a carriage; it contained the most
consoling and Scriptural aids and admonitions; it was
unfortunately lost by its possessor on a voyage to
India, or it would have proved, we are assured, an
acquisition to our memoir, of real interest and importance.</p>

<p>As he stepped out of his gig, his family easily
perceived from his manner if he had been visiting the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 271]</span>
chamber of death, and never presumed to break a
sacred silence that was sure to follow his deep-drawn
sigh till he was pleased to do so himself. This he did
in general by the solemn and subdued utterance of a
text from Scripture, or some verse of a favourite
hymn. The tears often fell down his aged cheeks while
slowly articulating, in a suppressed voice, &#8220;Blessed
are the dead which die in the Lord;&#8221; or from one of
Watts&#8217;s hymns.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 20em;">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Oh could we die with those that die,&#8221; etc.</span>
</div>

<p>After this touching relief he seemed to feel more
at liberty to speak on future events connected with
his own decease, when he should be sitting down, as
he frequently said, with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in
the kingdom of God. Indeed his happy, social spirit
led him to connect the joys of heaven with the society
of saints and patriarchs and his own departed friends.
Sitting at dinner with the bishop and others as his
guests, his mind abstracted itself from the surrounding
scene, and he addressed the Christian friend to whose
notices of his last days we have already had recourse:
&#8220;You know, madam, you and I are to take an
alphabetical list some day of all the names of the good
men I expect soon to meet in heaven; there will be
(counting them up upon his fingers) John Wesley,
Isaac Watts, the two Milners, Joseph and Isaac, John
Newton and Thomas Scott, Mr. Howels of Long
Acre, and Matthew Henry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Here the conversation
of the party broke off the solemn reverie.</p>

<p>Yet all this tranquillity was consistent with that
natural fear of death which for the wisest purposes
God has implanted in man, and which Adam must have
known in paradise, or else the Divine prohibition and
the threatened penalty, &#8220;in the day that thou eatest<span class="pagenum">[Pg 272]</span>
thereof thou shalt surely die,&#8221; could have had no
force and appealed to no motive. &#8220;In the month of
September, after his last voyage, he called at the
house of his friend, the Rev. Mr. Cartwright, with a
young lady from New Zealand, to introduce her to
Mrs. Cartwright. The door was opened by his aged
and now deeply afflicted friend and brother in the
ministry, for Mrs. Cartwright had expired in the
night, after a few hours&#8217; illness. Mr. Marsden, with
his usual cheerfulness of manner, said, &#8216;Well! I
have brought Miss W. to introduce her to Mrs.
Cartwright.&#8217; &#8216;Stop! stop, my friend,&#8217; responded
the mourner, in a solemn manner, &#8216;don&#8217;t you know
that Mrs. Cartwright is dead?&#8217; &#8216;Dead? dead?&#8217;
replied Mr. Marsden. &#8216;Oh no; oh no. You must
be in joke; it is too serious a matter to make a joke
of, Mr. Cartwright.&#8217; &#8216;Indeed,&#8217; responded Mr.
Cartwright, &#8216;it is too true. Come, and I will
convince you,&#8217; and then led him to the room where
the remains of his departed wife lay. Mr. Marsden
approached the body, saying, &#8216;Oh! she is not dead;
no, no, she is not dead;&#8217; (the bright complexion
remaining unchanged), &#8216;she is not dead;&#8217; and then,
passing his hand over the face, the cold chill of death
dissipated the delusion. &#8216;Yes, she is dead, she is
dead,&#8217; and leaving the room, he hurried away to give
vent to his feelings.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he contemplated his own near approach to the
eternal state, a few chosen passages of Scripture fell
often from his lips; and it was remarked they were
almost the only repetitions he made use of; for his mind
was richly stored with Scripture, which he seemed to
bring forth with endless variety, and often in the
happiest combination; but now he often repeated the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 273]</span>
words of Job, &#8220;He cometh forth like a flower, and is
cut down; he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth
not,&#8221; chap. xiv. 2. And those of Zechariah, &#8220;Your
fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they
live for ever?&#8221; chap. i. 5.</p>

<p>Like Cornelius, he had been a devout man, a man
of prayer through life. He believed in the promises
of effectual aid from God the Holy Spirit, to carry on
the work of grace in his own soul. Nerved with this
faith, he waged a ceaseless war against corruptions
within, and temptations from without. And while he
viewed the promises of assistance from the Holy
Spirit, as given not to supersede our own exertions,
but to animate them, he simply trusted to Him to
become the author of his complete sanctification. And
all the blessed fruits of faith were found richly
clustering round his character. It was his constant
habit, after his return from a journey, to spend some
time in his room alone, engaged, no doubt, in holy
communing with God. When he prayed in the
family, or before his sermon in the pulpit, where he
seldom used a form, the rich and fervid unction, the
variety and copiousness of his supplications and
thanksgivings, seemed to intimate how closely he had
been wont to commune in secret with his heavenly
Father. The fifty-first Psalm now often supplied the
words for many a humble confession of sin, and many
an earnest aspiration for larger supplies of the Holy
Spirit&#8217;s sanctifying influences, both in the pulpit and
elsewhere. He appears always to have held frequent
communion with God in ejaculatory prayer throughout
the day. To one whose engagements were so many,
and whose interruptions were necessarily so frequent,
the practice was no doubt most beneficial. Thus<span class="pagenum">[Pg 274]</span>
the lamp of God in his soul was always trimmed, and
the light went not out as age and infirmities drew on.
His friends now remarked his frequent abstraction from
the scenes around, while his moving lip and solemn
gesture significantly intimated the direction of his mind,
and the occupation of his thoughts. His mind became
daily more spiritual, and even when in the midst of
visitors he seemed often to be absorbed in silent prayer.</p>

<p>&#8220;An incident which seems to show that he had a
presentiment of his approaching end occurred on the
last Sunday on which the holy communion was administered
before his death. Although in his usual health,
he did not assist in the service, as he always had done
for a long period of forty-five years in the same
congregation; and when the officiating minister was
ready to distribute the bread and wine, he remained
in his pew, apparently overcome by his feelings. A
pause ensued, when, as he still did not attempt to
move, the Rev. Henry Bobart, his son-in-law, thought
it advisable to take the elements to him. Many of
his congregation were affected to tears, impressed
with the belief that they might not again receive from
his venerable hands those emblems of the Saviour&#8217;s love.
He had never yet been present at the church without
assisting at the solemn rite. Such fears were but too
truly and sadly realized. On the Sunday evening, at the
parsonage, it was the custom, at family worship, to
read one of a course of sermons. The Sunday before
his death, when he was still apparently as well as
usual, he requested that the one in course for that
evening might be laid aside and Bradley&#8217;s sermon
the &#8216;Morrow unknown,&#8217; from the text &#8216;Boast not
thyself of to-morrow,&#8217; substituted. Some slight
objection was made; but on his again expressing his<span class="pagenum">[Pg 275]</span>
wish, it was of course complied with. The remarks
made by him upon the subject during the evening
excited the apprehensions of his family that the coming
week might be one of trial, but they little thought
that ere the next sabbath one so loved and revered
would be removed from them.&#8221;</p>

<p>On Tuesday the 8th of May, 1838, a few of his
friends visited him at his own house; he wore his
usual cheerfulness, and they wished him, as they
thought, a short farewell as he stepped into his gig on
a journey of about five and-twenty-miles. In passing
through the low lands contiguous to Windsor, the
cold suddenly affected him, and he complained of
illness on his arrival at the house of his friend, the
Rev. Mr. Styles, the chaplain of the parish. Erysipelas
in the head broke out, and a general stupor followed,
so that he became insensible. His mind wandered
amongst the scenes to which his life had been devoted,
and he uttered a few incoherent expressions about the
factory, the orphan school, and the New Zealand
mission. &#8220;Though he spoke but little,&#8221; says his
friend, Mr. Styles, in his funeral sermon, &#8220;yet in his
few conscious moments he said quite enough to show
that the Saviour whom he served through life was
with him in the time of trial. A single remark was
made to him by a bystander on the value of a good
hope in Christ in the hour of need. &#8216;Yes,&#8217; said he,
&#8216;that hope is indeed precious to me now;&#8217; and on
the following evening, his last on earth, he was heard
repeating the words &#8216;precious, precious,&#8217; as if still
in the same strain of thought which that remark had
suggested. Soon after, inflammation having reached
the brain, his spirit was released. On Saturday
morning, the 12th of May, he entered&mdash;who can<span class="pagenum">[Pg 276]</span>
doubt?&mdash;upon the enjoyment of his &#8216;eternal and
exceeding great reward.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He was buried in his own churchyard at Paramatta.
Upwards of sixty carriages formed the mourning train,
and a numerous assemblage of mourners, including
most of the public functionaries in the colony, followed
him to the grave. Of these, some who had in years
long past thwarted and opposed him came at last to
offer an unfeigned tribute of deep respect. A few had
been his early associates in the ministry, and in every
good word and work. The majority were a youthful
generation, to whom he was only known as a wise and
venerable minister of God. His parishioners had been
most of them brought up under his instructions, and
had been taught from their infancy to look up to him
with respect and love. The solemn burial service was
read by the Rev. Dr. Cowper, who first came out to the
colony at Mr. Marsden&#8217;s solicitation. He stood over
the grave and addressed the mourners on the early
devotedness of their departed friend and pastor to the
great work of the ministry, told them how solemnly
he had dedicated himself to God before he left England
in his youth, and reminded them of the fidelity with
which through evil and good report he had endured
his Master&#8217;s cross, despising the shame.</p>

<p>Australia seemed at length fully to appreciate his
worth. It was quite fitting, and indeed an additional
tribute to his integrity, that some mutterings of
calumny should be uttered by ungodly men, even as the
grave closed over him, and that a priest of the apostate
church of Rome should catch them up, and gladly
give expression to them. With this exception the
colony was unanimous, as were the friends of religion<span class="pagenum">[Pg 277]</span>
in England, and throughout the world, in mourning
for him as for one who had been great as an evangelist
in the church of Christ, and as a philanthropist
second to none who have ever devoted their lives to
the welfare of their fellow creatures. It was proposed
to erect a monument to his memory by public subscription;
the proposition was warmly approved on
all sides, and subscriptions were offered to a considerable
amount. Whole families became subscribers&mdash;parents,
and children, and domestic servants, all ready
thus to testify their reverence. On further consideration,
it was thought better to erect a church to his
memory on a piece of his own land, which he himself
had devised for that purpose, to which the name of
Marsfield should be given; and the design, we believe,
has been carried into effect, at the cost of about six
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>The public press, not only in Australia but in
England, published biographical sketches of his life
and labours, with articles on his motives and character.
The great missionary societies recorded his death with
becoming feelings of reverential love. The notice of
him in the minutes of the Church Missionary Society,
the reader will not be displeased to find in these pages.
It was read at their annual meeting at Exeter-hall, and
published in their thirtieth report.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Committee of the Church Missionary Society
record the death of the late Rev. Samuel Marsden with
feelings of deep respect for his personal character and
gratitude to the Great Head of the church, who raised
up, and who so long preserved, this distinguished man,
for the good of his own, and of future generations.</p>

<p>&#8220;In him the Committee recognise an individual
whom Providence had endowed with a vigorous<span class="pagenum">[Pg 278]</span>
constitution, both of body and mind, suited to meet the
circumstances which ever attend a course of new and
arduous labours. Entering upon the duties of his chaplaincy
forty-five years ago, at a time when the colonists
of New South Wales were, for the most part, of abandoned
character and suffering the penalty of the law,
he, with admirable foresight, anticipated the probable
future destinies of that singular and important colony,
and never ceased to call the attention of both the local
and home governments to the great duty of providing
for the interests, both temporal and spiritual, of the
rapidly increasing population by a proportionate increase
in the number of colonial chaplains.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the discharge of his diversified duties, the
native energies of his mind were conspicuously exhibited
in the undisturbed ardour, public spirit, and steady
perseverance, with which his various plans of usefulness
were prosecuted; while his high natural gifts
were sanctified by those Christian principles, which
from his youth up, he maintained and adorned, both
by his teaching and by his life.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is to his exertions in behalf of Christian
missions that the Committee are bound especially to
call the attention of the Society. While he omitted
no duty of his proper ministerial calling, his comprehensive
mind quickly embraced the vast spiritual interests,
till then well nigh entirely unheeded, of the
innumerable islands of the Pacific Ocean, whose &#8216;inhabitants
were sitting in darkness, and in the shadow of
death.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Under the influence of these considerations, Mr.
Marsden zealously promoted the labours of the different
societies which have established missions in the South
Seas. And it is to his visits to New Zealand, begun<span class="pagenum">[Pg 279]</span>
twenty-five years ago, and often since repeated, and to
his earnest appeals on behalf of that people, that the
commencement and consolidation of the Society&#8217;s missions
in the Northern Island are to be attributed.</p>

<p>&#8220;In calling to mind the long series of eminent services
rendered to the Society by Mr. Marsden, the
committee notice with peculiar satisfaction the last
visit made by him, in the year 1836, to the Society&#8217;s
missions in New Zealand&mdash;a visit justly termed by the
Lord Bishop of Australia &#8216;Apostolical.&#8217; With paternal
authority and affection, and with the solemnity of one
who felt himself to be standing on the verge of
eternity, he then gave his parting benediction to the
missionaries and the native converts.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>And thus was the man honoured in his death, whose
life had been one long conflict with obloquy and
slander. With few exceptions his enemies had died
away, or been gradually led to abandon their prejudices,
and many of them now loved and revered the man
whom they had once hated or despised. This, however,
is but the usual recompense of a life of consistent
holiness. God often allows his servants to live and
even to die under a cloud of prejudice; but sooner or
later, even the world does homage to their virtues and
confesses its admiration of the Christian character,
while the church of Christ glorifies God in the grace
which made their departed brother to shine as a light
in the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<blockquote><p>Character of Mr. Marsden&mdash;His Life and Labours.</p></blockquote>

<p>The reader may naturally expect in conclusion a
summary of Mr. Marsden&#8217;s character. In attempting
this, we are by no means insensible to the difficulty of
the undertaking. Indiscriminate eulogy, and the
arrogance which affects to blame in order to establish its
own claim to superior wisdom, are both alike impertinent
and unbecoming. Yet it is not easy to speak of one
whose motives were so high, whose labours so constant
and self-denying, and whose triumphs so remarkable,
without enthusiasm. While, on the other hand, those
infirmities which may generally be detected even in
the best men, and which truth requires to be impartially
noted down, did not much affect his public
life; and we have felt all along as we have written
with the disadvantage of having known him only
by the report of others. Still, however, something
should be attempted. The character of Mr. Marsden
is too instructive to be lost; perhaps few great men
ever lived whose example was more calculated for
general usefulness,&mdash;for the simple reason that he
displayed no gigantic powers, no splendid genius;
he had only a solid, well ordered, mind, with which
to work,&mdash;no other endowments than those which
thousands of his fellow men possess. It was in the <i>use
of his materials</i> that his greatness lay.</p>

<p>Mr. Marsden was a man of a masculine understanding,
of great decision of character, and an energy
which nothing could subdue. He naturally possessed<span class="pagenum">[Pg 281]</span>
such directness and honesty of purpose, that his intentions
could never be mistaken; and he seemed incapable
of attempting to gain his purpose by those dexterous
shifts and man&oelig;uvres which often pass current,
even amongst professing Christians, as the proper, if
not laudable, resources of a good diplomatist, or a
thorough man of business. When he had an object in
view, it was always worthy of his strenuous pursuit,
and nothing stopped him in his efforts to obtain it,
except the impossibility of proceeding further. Had
his mind been less capacious such firmness would often
have degenerated into mere obstinacy; had it been
less benevolent and less under the influence of religion,
it would have led him, as he pressed rudely onwards,
to trample upon the feelings, perhaps upon the rights,
of other men. But he seems, whenever he was not
boldly confronting vice, to have been of the gentlest
nature. In opposing sin, especially when it showed
itself with effrontery in the persons of magistrates and
men in power, he gave no quarter and asked for none.
There was a quaintness and originality about him,
which enabled him to say and do things which were
impossible to other men. There was a firmness and
inflexibility, combined with earnest zeal, which in the
days of the reformers would have placed him in their
foremost rank. None could be long in his society
without observing that he was a man of another mould
than those around him. There was an air of unconscious
independence in all he did which, mixed with
his other qualities, clearly showed to those who could
read his character, that he was a peculiar instrument
in the hands of God to carry out his own purposes.
These traits are illustrated by many remarkable events
in his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 282]</span>When he first arrived in New South Wales, while
theft, blasphemy, and every other crime, prevailed to
an alarming extent among the convicts, the higher
classes of society, the civil and military officers, set a
disgraceful example of social immorality. Such is the
account given by a Sydney periodical a few weeks
after Mr. Marsden&#8217;s decease, which goes on to say:
&#8220;Many an individual of a more plastic nature might
have been moulded by the prevailing fashion of the
age in which he lived, and instead of endeavouring to
struggle against the tide of popular opinion, would
have yielded in all probability to its seducing influence.
Such was not the case with Mr. Marsden. When he
was opposed on all hands, and even by the civil and
military authorities of the day, he faithfully performed
his duty, and careless of the powerful coalitions combined
for his destruction, &#8216;all the ends he aimed at
were his country&#8217;s, his God&#8217;s, and truth&#8217;s.&#8217; Educated
in the school of the Milners, the Simeons, and the
Fletchers, he was not disposed to flatter the vices of
any man; but with plainness and sincerity of speech,
he discoursed &#8216;of righteousness, temperance and judgment
to come.&#8217;&#8221; He has been known to rebuke sin
at a dinner-table in such a manner as to electrify the
whole company. Once, arriving late, he sat down
in haste, and did not for a few minutes perceive the
presence of one who should have been the wife of the
host, but who stood in a very different relation to him.
Mr. Marsden always turned a deaf ear to scandal, and
in the excess of his charity was sometimes blind to facts
which were evident enough to others. The truth now
flashed upon him, and though such things were little
thought of in the colony, he rose instantly from the
table, calling to the servant in a decided tone to bring<span class="pagenum">[Pg 283]</span>
his hat, and without further ceremony, or another
word, retired. That such a man should raise up a
host of bitter enemies is not to be wondered at.</p>

<p>To these qualities his great successes in life, under
God, were due. The young chaplain who single handed
confronted and at length bore down the profligacy of
New South Wales, and the shameless partiality of its
courts of justice (the immediate result and consequence
of the licentious lives and connexions of the magistrates)
planned, and was himself the first to adventure
upon the mission to New Zealand. Against the rashness
of this attempt the timid expostulations of his
friends, the hesitation of the captains who declined so
perilous an adventure, and even the remonstrances of
Governor Macquarie himself weighed not a feather in
the scale. He saw his way clearly; it was the path
of duty, and along it he must go. And when, ten
years afterwards, scarcely a nominal convert had been
won from among the cannibals, when tens of thousands
of good money had been spent, when the church at
home was almost weary of the project, and half disposed
to give it up, he was still true as ever to the cause. He
neither bolstered up his courage with noisy protestations,
nor attempted to cheer the languid zeal of others
by the slightest exaggerations, but quietly went forward
calmly resting upon the two great pillars, the
<i>commands</i> and the <i>promises</i> of God. So again with
respect to the Polynesian missions; at first he showed
little of that enthusiasm in which some of its promoters
were caught as in a whirlwind, and carried off their
feet. But high principle endures when enthusiasm
has long worn out. And it was to the firm and yet
cheering remonstrances of Samuel Marsden, and to the
weight which his representations had with the churches<span class="pagenum">[Pg 284]</span>
of Christ in England, that the directors were indebted
for the ability to maintain their ground, and that this
perhaps the most successful of Protestant missions,
was not finally abandoned upon the very eve of its
triumphs.</p>

<p>While he embraced large and comprehensive projects,
it was one of his striking peculiarities that he
paid close attention to minute details. Some minds
beginning with the vast and theoretical, work backwards
into the necessary details; others setting out
upon that which is minute and practical, from the
necessities of the hour and the duties of the day before
them seem to enlarge their circle and to build up new
projects as they proceed. The former may be men of
greater genius, but the latter are in general the more
successful, and to these Mr. Marsden belonged. The
cast of his mind was eminently practical. No crude
visions of distant triumphs led him away from the
duties which belonged to the scene and circumstances
in which providence had placed him. Paramatta was
for many years the model parish of New South Wales,
although its pastor was the soul of the New Zealand
mission, and of many a philanthropic enterprise besides.
Commissioner Biggs, in his &#8220;Report of Inquiry,&#8221;
which was published by order of the House of
Commons, observes that &#8220;Mr. Marsden, though much
occupied by the business of the missions which he
conducted, and by the superintendence of the orphan
school which he had himself called into existence, was
remarkably attentive to the duties of his ministry.&#8221;
&#8220;The congregation at Paramatta appeared to me to
be more respectable than at the other places of worship,
and the choral parts of the service were admirably
performed by the singers, who have been taught under<span class="pagenum">[Pg 285]</span>
the direction of the Rev. S. Marsden.&#8221; He was well
known to all his parishioners, to whom he paid
constant ministerial visits; his attention to the sick,
whether at their own homes or the government hospital,
was unremitting, and here his natural shrewdness,
sharpened as it was by his spiritual penetration, showed
itself in his insight into the true character of those he
dealt with. Nothing disgusted him more than a want
of reality. High professions from inconsistent lips
were loathsome to him, and his rebukes were sometimes
sharp. A gentleman, whose habits of life were
not altogether consistent with Christian simplicity and
deadness to the world, had been reading &#8220;Mammon,&#8221;
when that volume had just made its appearance, and with
that partial eye with which we are too apt to view our
own failings, had come to the flattering conclusion that
by contrast with the monster depicted in &#8220;Mammon,&#8221;
the desires he felt to add field to field and house to
house, were not covetousness, but that diligence in
business which the Scriptures inculcate. In the happy
excitement of the discovery, he exultingly exclaimed,
&#8220;Well, thank God, I have no covetousness.&#8221; Mr.
Marsden, who had read no more about covetousness
than he found in the Bible, had sat silent; rising from
his chair, and taking his hat, he merely said, &#8220;Well,
I think it is time for me to go: and so, sir, you thank
God that you are not as other men are. You have no
covetousness? havn&#8217;t you? Why, sir, I suppose the
next thing you&#8217;ll tell us is that you&#8217;ve no pride;&#8221; and
left the room.</p>

<p>But when he spoke to a modest inquirer, these
roughnesses, which lay only on the surface, disappeared.
To the sick, his manner was gentle and affectionate,
and in his later years, when he began, from<span class="pagenum">[Pg 286]</span>
failing memory and dimness of sight, to feel himself
unequal to the pulpit, he spent much of his time in
going from house to house and amongst the prison
population, exhorting and expounding the Scriptures.
Upon one of these occasions, a friend who accompanied
him relates that he made a short journey to visit a
dying young lady, whose parents on some account were
strangely averse to his intrusion, pastoral though it
was. But the kindness with which he addressed the
sufferer, whom he found under deep spiritual anxieties,
and the soothing manner in which he spoke and prayed
with her, instantly changed the whole bias of their
minds. &#8220;To think,&#8221; they exclaimed when he left the
house, &#8220;of the aged man, with his silver locks, coming
such a distance as seventeen miles, and speaking so
affectionately to our feeble child!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Paramatta, his Sunday-school,&#8221; his daughter
writes, &#8220;was in a more efficient state than any I have
since seen;&#8221; and the same remark might probably be applied
to his other parochial institutions, for whatever
he did was done with all his heart; and he was one of
those who easily find coadjutors. Their example seems
to shed an immediate influence. And his curates and
the pious members of his flock were scarcely less
zealous and energetic than himself.</p>

<p>He found time to promote missionary meetings, and
to encourage the formation of tract and Bible societies,
as well as other benevolent institutions, at Sydney
and other places. On many occasions he delivered
interesting speeches, and not long before his death he
presided at a Bible Society meeting at Paramatta,
when, in the course of an affectionate address, he
alluded to his beloved New Zealand. New Zealand
was near his heart, and he now seldom spoke of it<span class="pagenum">[Pg 287]</span>
without being sensibly affected. Relating an anecdote
respecting Mowhee, a converted New Zealander,
he was completely overcome, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>His manner of preaching was simple, forcible, and
persuasive, rather than powerful or eloquent. In his
later years, when he was no longer able to read his
sermons, he preached extempore. His memory, until
the last year or two of his life, was remarkably tenacious:
he used to repeat the whole of the burial
service <i>memoriter</i>, and in the pulpit, whole chapters or
a great variety of texts from all parts of Scripture, as
they were required to prove or illustrate his subject.
He was seldom controversial, nor did he attempt a
critical exposition of the word of God. His ministry
was pure and evangelical. &#8220;You can well remember
him, my hearers,&#8221; says the preacher, in his funeral
sermon, &#8220;as having faithfully preached to you the
word of God; clearly did he lay before you the whole
counsel of God. Man was represented by him as in
a condemned and helpless state, lying in all the pollution
and filthiness of his sin, totally unable to justify
himself wholly or in part, by any works of righteousness
which he can do; God, as too pure to look upon
iniquity without abhorrence, and yet too merciful to
leave sinners to their sad estate without providing a
refuge for them; Christ, as All in all to the sinner;
as wisdom to enlighten him, as righteousness to justify
him, sanctification to make him holy in heart and life,
as complete redemption from the bondage of sin and
death into the glorious inheritance of heaven; the
Holy Spirit of God as the only author of aught that
is good in the renewed soul; faith as the only means
of applying the salvation of the gospel to the case of
the individual sinner; justification by faith; the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 288]</span>
necessity of regeneration; holiness indispensable. All
these were represented by your departed minister as
the vital doctrines of the gospel, and the mutual bearing
and connexion of each was clearly shown. And
this he has been doing for nearly forty-five years.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dwelling on the outskirts of civilization and of the
Christian world, he was too deeply impressed with
the grand line of distinction between Christianity and
hideous ungodliness, whether exhibited in the vices of
a penal settlement or the cannibalism of New Zealand,
to be likely to attach too much importance to those
minor shades of difference which are to be met with
in the great family of Jesus Christ. As his heart was
large, so too was his spirit catholic. He was sincerely
and affectionately attached to the church of England.
He revered her liturgy, and in her articles and homilies
he found his creed, and he laboured much to promote
her extension. Yet his heart was filled with
love to all those who name the name of Christ in sincerity.
Wherever he met with the evidences of real
piety and soundness of doctrine, his house and his
purse flew open; and orthodox Christians of every
denomination from time to time either shared his hospitalities
or were assisted in their benevolent projects
with pecuniary aid. With what delicacy this was done
may be gathered from such statements as the following,
which is copied from the &#8220;Colonist&#8221; newspaper, September
12th, 1838: &#8220;An attempt having been made to
build a Scotch church in Sydney, the colonial government
for a time opposed the scheme, and in consequence
some of its friends fell away. Then it was that
the late Samuel Marsden, unsolicited, very generously
offered the loan of 750<i>l.</i> to the trustees of the Scotch
church, on the security of the building and for its<span class="pagenum">[Pg 289]</span>
completion. This loan was accordingly made; but as
it was found impracticable to give an available security
on the building, Mr. Marsden agreed to take the personal
guarantee of the minister for the debt.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the same spirit he presented the Wesleyan
Methodists with a valuable piece of land on which
to erect a chapel, at Windsor. This act of Christian
charity was acknowledged by their missionaries in a
grateful letter. Mr. Marsden&#8217;s reply is full of warmth
and feeling. &#8220;You express your acknowledgment
for the ground at Windsor to build your chapel and
house upon. I can only say I feel much pleasure in
having it in my power to meet your wishes in this
respect. To give you the right hand of fellowship is
no more than my indispensable duty; and were I to
throw the smallest difficulty in your way I should be
highly criminal and unworthy the Christian name,
more especially considering the present circumstances
of these extensive settlements, &#8216;where the harvest is
so great and the labourers are so few.&#8217; ...
The importation of convicts from Europe is very great
every year; hundreds have just landed on our shores
from various parts of the British empire, hundreds are
now in the harbour ready to be disembarked, and hundreds
more on the bosom of the great deep are hourly
expected. These exiles come to us laden with the
chains of their sins, and reduced to the lowest state of
human wretchedness and depravity. We must not
expect that magistrates and politicians can find a
remedy for the dreadful moral diseases with which the
convicts are infected. The plague of sin, when it has
been permitted to operate on the human mind with all
its violence and poison, can never be cured, and seldom
restrained by the wisest human laws and regulations.
Heaven itself has provided the only remedy<span class="pagenum">[Pg 290]</span>
for sin&mdash;the blessed balm in Gilead; to apply any
other remedy is lost labour. In recommending this
at all times and in all places, we shall prevail upon
some to try its effect; and whoever do this we know
they will be healed in the selfsame hour. I pray that
the Divine blessing may attend all your labours for
the good of immortal souls in these settlements.&#8221;</p>

<p>His private charities displayed the same catholic
spirit. His disinterestedness was great, and his only
desire seemed to be to assist the deserving or to retrieve
the lost. He was not foolishly indifferent to the value
of money, as those who had business transactions with
him were well aware; but its chief value in his eyes
consisted in the opportunities it gave him to promote
the happiness of others. Hundreds of instances of
his extraordinary liberality might be mentioned, and
it is probable that many more are quite unknown.
The following anecdotes, furnished by his personal
friends, will show that his bounty was dealt out with
no sparing hand.</p>

<p>A gentleman, at whose house he was a visitor, happened
to express a wish that he had three hundred
pounds to pay off a debt. The next morning Mr.
Marsden came down and presented him with the
money, taking no acknowledgment. The circumstance
would have remained unknown had not the obliged
person, after Mr. Marsden&#8217;s decease, honourably sent
an acknowledgment to his executors. All he assisted
were not equally grateful. Travelling with a friend in
his carriage, a vehicle passed by. &#8220;Paddy,&#8221; said he,
calling to his servant, &#8220;who is that?&#8221; On being
told, &#8220;Oh,&#8221; said he, &#8220;he borrowed from me two hundred
pounds, and he never paid me.&#8221; This was his
only remark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 291]</span>Yet he was not tenacious for repayment, nor indeed
exact in requiring it at all where he thought the persons
needy and deserving. The same friend was with
him when a man called to pay up the interest on a
considerable sum which Mr. Marsden had lent to him.
He took a cheque for the amount, but when the person
retired, tore it up and threw it into the fire, remarking,
&#8220;He is an honest man. I am satisfied if he
returns me the principal; that is all I want.&#8221;</p>

<p>On another occasion, a friend who had been requested
to make an advance of fifty pounds to a needy
person, but was unable to do so, mentioned the case
to Mr. Marsden, with, &#8220;Sir, can you lend me fifty
pounds?&#8221; &#8220;To be sure I can,&#8221; was the answer, and
the money was instantly produced. When he called,
shortly afterwards, to repay the loan, Mr. Marsden
had forgotten all about it. &#8220;Indeed I never looked
to its being repaid.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Rev&mdash;&mdash;, being pressed for a hundred pounds,
walking with Mr. Marsden, mentioned his difficulties.
Mr. Marsden at once gave him a hundred pounds,
simply remarking, &#8220;I dare say that will do for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A lady had come to the colony at the solicitation of
her family, with the view of establishing a school of a
superior class for the daughters of the colonists. At
first she met with little success. Mr. Marsden saw
the importance of her scheme, and at once invited her
to Paramatta, offering her a suitable house and all the
pecuniary aid she might require, and this under the
feeling of a recent disappointment in an undertaking
of the same nature.</p>

<p>Of the large sums he expended on the New Zealand
mission from his own private resources it is impossible
even to conjecture the amount, to say nothing of a<span class="pagenum">[Pg 292]</span>
life in a great measure devoted to the service. He
one day called upon a young man of enterprise and
piety, whom he was anxious to induce to settle in
New Zealand, and offered him fifty pounds per annum
out of his own purse, as well as to raise a further
sum for him from other sources. Nor should it be
forgotten, in proof of this disinterestedness, that with
all his opportunities and influence in New Zealand, he
never possessed a single acre of land there, or sought
the slightest advantage either for himself or for any
member of his family.</p>

<p>Another feature in his character was his unaffected
humility. This was not in him the nervous weakness
which disqualifies some men for vigorous action, rendering
them either unconscious of their power, or
incapable of maintaining and asserting their position,
and consequently of discharging its obligations. This,
though often called humility, is, in fact, disease, and
ought to be resisted rather than indulged. Mr. Marsden&#8217;s
mind was vigorous and healthy; he took a just
measure of his powers and opportunities, as the use
he put them to proves abundantly. There was nothing
in him of the shyness which disqualifies for public
life; he was bold without effrontery, courageous
without rashness, firm without obstinacy; but withal
he was a humble man. His private correspondence
will have shown the reader how anxious he was to
submit his own judgment, even on questions affecting
his personal character, to what he considered the
better judgment of his friends at home. To vanity or
ostentation he seems to have been a perfect stranger.
There is not a passage in his correspondence, nor can
we learn that a word ever fell from his lips, which
would lead us to suppose that he ever thought him<span class="pagenum">[Pg 293]</span>self
in any way an extraordinary man. Flattery disgusted
him, and even moderate praise was offensive to
his feelings. When the life of his friend, Dr. Mason
Good, appeared from the pen of Dr. Olinthus Gregory,
it contained an appendix, giving an account of
his own labours and triumphs at Paramatta and in
New Zealand. This he cut out of the volume with
his penknife, without any remark, before he permitted
it to lie upon his table or to be read by his family.
He was so far from thinking he had accomplished
much, either in the colony or amongst the heathen,
that he was rather disposed, in his later days, to
lament that his life had been almost useless; and
indeed he was heard more than once to express a
doubt whether he had not mistaken his calling, and
been no better than an intruder into the sacred ministry.
Perhaps failing health and spirits were in
part the cause of these misgivings, but his unfeigned
humility had a deeper root. It originated in that
evangelical piety upon which all his usefulness was
built. He saw the holiness of God, he saw his Divine
perfection reflected in his law, and though he had a
clear, abiding sense of his adoption through the grace
of our Lord Jesus Christ, this did not interfere with
a clear conception too of his own unworthiness.
When told one day, by a justly indignant friend, how
basely he was misrepresented, &#8220;Sir,&#8221; he exclaimed,
and the solemnity of his manner showed the depth of
his meaning, &#8220;these men don&#8217;t know the worst. Why,
sir, if I were to walk down the streets of Paramatta
with my heart laid bare, the very boys would pelt me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such was Samuel Marsden, a man whose memory is
to be revered and his example imitated. &#8220;Not merely
a good man,&#8221; says the preacher of his funeral sermon,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 294]</span>
&#8220;who filled up the place allotted to him on earth, and
then sank into his grave; not merely a faithful minister
of Christ, who loved and served his Saviour and
turned many to repentance, but more than either of
these. Rightly to estimate his character we must
view him as a peculiar man, raised up for an especial
purpose.&#8221; And he adds&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;As Luther in Germany, and John Knox in Scotland,
and Cranmer in England, were sent by the Head
of the church, and fitted with peculiar qualifications
to make known his glorious gospel, hidden in Romish
darkness, so too, no less truly, was <span class="smcap">Samuel Marsden</span>
raised up in this southern hemisphere, and admirably
fitted for the work, and made the instrument of diffusing
the light of that same gospel, and of bringing
it to bear on the darkness of New Zealand and the
Isles of the Sea, and upon the darkness, too, no less
real, of the depravity of society in early Australia.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2>APPENDIX I.</h2>

<blockquote><p>Progress of the Gospel and of Civilization in New Zealand, since Mr.
Marsden&#8217;s Decease.</p></blockquote>

<p>The great work of Mr. Marsden&#8217;s life was undoubtedly
the New Zealand mission; but he was also, as we
have seen, the early friend, the wise adviser, and not
unfrequently the generous host of that devoted band
of men who first essayed the introduction of the
gospel to the Society Islands. Each of these missions
has been attended with astonishing success; each has
produced what may be called magnificent results,&mdash;results
which already far exceed, in some respects, the
most sanguine hopes, extravagant as at the time they
seemed to be, of Mr. Marsden and his early coadjutors
some fifty years ago. Yet in other respects their
disappointment would have been great had they lived
to witness the present state of things, whether in New
Zealand or Tahiti. Instead of native tribes growing
up into Christian brotherhood, and asserting a national
independence, these beautiful islands have bowed to a
foreign yoke. Instead of native churches they have
rather assumed the form of offshoots and dependencies
of British churches. A great work has been accomplished,
and its fruits will never cease to ripen. But
events have occurred which only prophets could have
foreseen; changes have taken place which neither
political sagacity nor the saintly wisdom of those good
men who first projected our foreign missions amidst
storms of insult, or, what was worse to bear, the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 296]</span>
withering influences of a contemptuous neglect, anticipated.
It is often so in this world&#8217;s history. Our
successes, our trials, the events which happen to us,
our national history, and that of the church of Christ,
scoop out for themselves fresh channels, and flow
still onwards, but in the direction perhaps least of all
expected.</p>

<p>Our readers are, we trust, so far interested in the
details already given as to desire some further acquaintance
with the later history of these great missions
since Mr. Marsden&#8217;s death. This we propose
to give, briefly of course, for the subject would fill a
volume; and such a volume, whenever it shall be
written well and wisely, will be received with delight
by every intelligent member of the whole catholic
church of Christ.</p>

<p>We shall direct our attention in the first place to
<span class="smcap">New Zealand</span>.</p>

<p>Attempts to colonize upon a large scale, attended
with constant aggressions upon the native tribes, had
occurred before Mr. Marsden&#8217;s death, and awakened
his anxiety. A New Zealand Company was formed
in 1839, with the avowed object of purchasing land
from the Maories, and settling large tracts of the island
with English emigrants. It made no provision for
the spiritual welfare of the natives, nor indeed for
that of the European settlers; and it was evident
that, however well-intentioned, the project in the
hands of a mercantile company would be effected, as
such schemes always have been effected, only at the
cost of injustice and oppression to the natives. Meanwhile
danger was threatening from another quarter.
Louis Philippe now sat upon the throne of France.
Though not ambitious of military conquest, he was<span class="pagenum">[Pg 297]</span>
cunning and unprincipled, and anxious to extend the
power of France by force or fraud. Her colonial possessions
she had lost during her long war with England,
and now scarcely one of them remained. He
saw and coveted the islands of the Southern Ocean,
and resolved to repair his colonial empire by the addition
of these splendid and inviting prizes. It was
said, and we believe with truth, that a frigate was
already equipped and on the very point of sailing for
New Zealand with secret orders to annex that island
to the crown of France, when the English government,
tardily and with sincere reluctance, resolved to
anticipate the project and claim New Zealand for the
queen of England. This was done, and the island
was formally annexed to the English crown, and in
January, 1842, became an English colony.</p>

<p>For once the story of colonial annexation is neither
darkened with crime nor saddened with war and
bloodshed. The measure was essential both to the
security of the natives and to the work of the Protestant
missions. Lawlessness and anarchy were universal:
the Maori tribes were slaughtering one another;
the white man was slaughtering the Maori
tribes. For the native laws were obsolete, and the
laws of England no man yet had the power to enforce.</p>

<p>There was, too, on the part of England, and it was
strongly expressed in the British parliament, a determination
to secure, as far as possible, not only the
safety but the independence of the natives under their
old chiefs, and to leave them in possession of their
ancient usages and forms of government. In fact, the
authority of queen Victoria was to be that of a mild
protectorate rather than an absolute sovereignty. The
chiefs were to acknowledge the supremacy of the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 298]</span>
crown as represented in the governor. To him, and
not as heretofore to the field of battle, with its horrors
and cannibalism, were their disputes to be referred;
and in all doubtful questions English law, its maxims
and analogies, were to be held supreme. Upon these
easy terms the most fastidious will find little to blame
in our annexation of New Zealand. The Maories did
not exceed, it was computed, one hundred thousand
souls. Suppose they had been twice that number, still
they could scarcely be said to <i>occupy</i> the whole of an
island of the size of Ireland, and quite as fruitful.
There was still room for a vast influx of Europeans,
leaving to the natives wide tracts of land far beyond
their wants, either for tillage or the chase, or for a
nomad wandering life, had this been the habit of the
Maories. And when the threatened seizure by France
is thrown into the scale, few Protestants, of whatever
nation they may be, will hesitate to admit that the
conduct of England in this instance was both wise and
just.</p>

<p>The Maories in general accepted this new state of
things with satisfaction. Those of them who resided
on the coast and in the neighbourhood of the Bay of
Islands saw that the aggression of the colonists was
restrained, and that their own safety was secured.
Further in the interior, where the want of an English
protectorate was less felt, heart-burnings occurred,
fomented, as usual, by designing men, and aggravated
by the occasional outrage of individuals. Some of the
tribes resisted, and a war broke out, though happily
neither bloody nor of long duration, in which the
Maories maintained the reputation of their native
valour, even against English regiments. Nor was it
till the year 1849 that the peace of the island and the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 299]</span>
supremacy of the English crown were perfectly restored
and asserted.</p>

<p>For a time the progress of the gospel was triumphant.
For example, archdeacon William Williams
could report that the number of communicants
in the eastern district, beneath his care, had risen
from twenty-nine in 1840, to two thousand eight
hundred and ninety-three in 1850; and these were
&#8220;members of the congregation who were supposed to
walk in the narrow way. Here then,&#8221; he exclaims,
&#8220;is abundant encouragement; the little one is become
a thousand. In the course of ten years, there has been
time for the novelty of Christianity to wear away;
but, while some are gone back again to the beggarly
elements of the world, hitherto the Lord has blessed
his vineyards with increase.&#8221; In other districts the
progress of the gospel was equally gratifying. At
Tauranga, out of a population not exceeding two
thousand four hundred, upwards of eight hundred partook
of the Lord&#8217;s supper; and yet there were many
native Christians who, from various causes, had been
kept away from this ordinance. Other denominations
of Protestant Christians had likewise their trophies to
exhibit to the &#8220;praise of his grace,&#8221; who had crowned
their labours with success. &#8220;The facilities,&#8221; reports
one missionary, upon the eastern coast, &#8220;the facilities
for usefulness are great; the coast might become one
of the most interesting missionary gardens in the
world. Crowds can be got together at any time for
catechizing; the dear children are all anxious for
schooling; the native teachers and monitors put themselves
quite under your hands; and they are, I think,
a very improving and improvable class.&#8221;</p>

<p>Similar reports reached home from almost every<span class="pagenum">[Pg 300]</span>
station in New Zealand. At the intervention of a
missionary of the church of England, a Wesleyan
missionary, and an English lay gentleman, (the surveyor-general,)
the Waikato and Wangaroa tribes, bent
on mutual slaughter, laid down their arms at the instant
the battle should have joined. They had had their
war-dance; some random shots had even been fired;
their mediators had begun to despair; when at length,
towards evening, they agreed to leave the subject in
dispute between them (the right to a piece of land),
to Sir George Grey, the governor, and Te Werowero,
a native chieftain, for arbitration. The question was
put to the whole army, &#8220;Do you agree to this?&#8221;
Four hundred armed natives answered with one voice,
assenting. The question was put a second time, and
they again gave their consent. &#8220;The surveyor-general
giving the signal, we all,&#8221; says the missionary, &#8220;gave
three hearty cheers; after which the natives assembled
for evening-prayers, and,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;I trust I felt
thankful.&#8221; The accounts that reached England, filled
men&#8217;s hearts with astonishment; even upon the spot,
men long enured to the spiritual warfare with idolatry,
were amazed at the greatness of their triumph. They
wrote home in strains such as the following.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Rotorua is endeared to us by every tie that should
endear a place to a missionary&#8217;s heart. We came
hither, to a people utterly debased by everything that
was savage. Now, there is not a village or place
around us, where the morning and evening bell does
not call to prayer and praise, and where the sabbath
is not observed. I am sometimes astonished when I
look back upon the past, and remember what we have
passed through. If I think only of those scenes which
occurred to us during the southern war, the remem<span class="pagenum">[Pg 301]</span>brance
seems appalling. Now peace reigns in every
border; the native chapel stands conspicuous in almost
every Pa; wars seem almost forgotten; and for New
Zealand, the promise seems fulfilled, &#8216;I shall give thee
the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost
parts of the earth for thy possession.&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>New Zealand was at length, outwardly at least, a
Christian land. Bishop Selwyn had, in 1842, taken
charge of the church of England and the oversight of
her missions, and other denominations assumed a
fixed and settled character. The missionary began to
merge and disappear in the stated minister. The
ancient warrior chieftain too, was fading fast from
sight; and we cannot deny that, savage as he was, we
part from him with some feelings of respect. Who
that has a heart to feel, or any imagination capable of
being warmed by strains of exquisite pathos, can read
unmoved the last words of the dying Karepa? The
scene is in the lonely village of Te Hawera, of which
he was the chief. Mr. Colenzo, the missionary, arrived
just as his people, with loud cries, sitting around his
new-made tomb, bewailed his departure. At night
they gathered around their spiritual father in his tent,
and one of the natives thus related the last words of
Karepa.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;He summoned us all,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to come close
around him, and with much love exhorted us; talking
energetically, as was his custom, a long while, he said:&mdash;&#8216;You
well know that I have brought you, from time
to time, much riches, muskets, powder, hatchets, knives,
blankets. I afterwards heard of the new riches, called
faith. I sought it. I went to Manawatu; in those
days a long and perilous journey, for we were surrounded
by enemies; no man travelled alone: I saw<span class="pagenum">[Pg 302]</span>
the few natives who, it was said, had heard of it; but
they could not satisfy me. I sought further, but in
vain. I heard afterwards of a white man at Otaki,
and that with him was the spring where I could fill
my empty and dry calabash. I travelled to his place,
to Otaki, but in vain; he was gone&mdash;gone away ill.
I returned to you, my children, dark minded. Many
days passed by; the snows fell, they melted, they
disappeared; the buds expanded, and the tangled paths
of our low forests were again passable to the foot of
the native man. At last we heard of another white
man who was going about over mountains and through
forests and swamps, giving drink from his calabash to
the secluded native&mdash;to the remnants of the tribes of
the mighty, of the renowned of former days, now
dwelling by twos and threes among the roots of the
big trees of the ancient forests, and among the long
reeds by the rills in the valleys. Yes, my grandchildren,
my and your ancestors, once spread over the
country as the Koitarek (<i>quail</i>) and Krivi (<i>apteryx</i>)
once did; but now their descendants are even as the
descendants of these birds, scarce, gone, dead, fast
hastening to utter extinction. Yes, we heard of that
white man; we heard of his going over the high snowy
range to Patea, all over the rocks to Turakire. I sent
four of my children to meet him. They saw his face;
yes you, you talked with him. You brought me a
drop of water from his calabash. You told me he had
said he would come to this far-off isle to see me. I
rejoiced, I disbelieved his coming; but I said he may.
I built the chapel, we waited expecting. You slept at
nights; I did not. He came, he emerged from the
long forest, he stood upon Te Hawera ground. I saw
him. I shook hands with him; we rubbed noses<span class="pagenum">[Pg 303]</span>
together. Yes, I saw a missionary&#8217;s face; I sat in his
cloth house (<i>tent</i>); I tasted his new food; I heard him
talk Maori; my heart bounded within me; I listened;
I ate his words. You slept at nights; I did not. Yes,
I listened, and he told me about God, and his Son
Jesus Christ, and of peace and reconciliation, and of a
loving Father&#8217;s home beyond the stars. And now I,
too, drank from his calabash and was refreshed, he
gave me a book, as well as words. I laid hold of the
new riches for me, and for you, and we have it now.
My children, I am old; my teeth are gone, my hair is
white; the yellow leaf is falling from the Twai (<i>beech
tree</i>); I am departing; the sun is sinking behind the
great western hills, it will soon be night. But, hear
me; hold fast the new riches&mdash;the great riches&mdash;the
true riches. We have had plenty of sin and pain
and death; but now we have the true riches. Hold
fast the true riches, which Karepa sought out for
you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here he became faint, and ceased talking. We
all wept like little children around the bed of the dying
old man&mdash;of our father. He suffered much pain, from
which he had scarcely any cessation until death
relieved him.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>But New Zealand was now passing through a
dangerous crisis. The Maori ceased to exist in his
savage state. Cannibalism was a mere tradition. Of
the ancient superstitions scarcely a trace was left.
European arts and manners were introduced in almost
every part of the island, and New Zealand took her
place amongst other civilized communities. Still, under
new circumstances fresh dangers threatened her. The
church of Rome saw from afar and coveted so glorious
a possession; and in the course of a single year a<span class="pagenum">[Pg 304]</span>
Romish bishop and sixteen priests landed at Wellington,
and a second bishop with his troop of priests
and nuns at Auckland. For a while the childish
simplicity of the Maori character, fond of show and a
stranger to suspicion, gave them great advantage; and
the missionaries of evangelical churches viewed their
progress with serious apprehension. But as the novelty
wore off the Maori Christian discovered that
Popery was but a hollow pretence, without heart, or
life, or abiding consolation, and whole tribes which had
been led astray returned with their chiefs to purer
churches in search of better pasturage. Lately the translation
of the whole of the Bible has been completed,
and in this we have the best antidote, under God, to
the progress of this baneful superstition. New Zealand,
too, besides its several Protestant bishops of the
church of England, its zealous missionaries, and
stated ministers of every evangelical denomination, has
now at length a native ministry of her own Maories,
few as yet in number, but holy men, men of competent
learning and gifts of utterance, who have evidently
been called of God. One of these, the Rev. Riwai Te
Ahu, who was ordained by Bishop Selwyn, is not only
highly esteemed by all the natives of whatever tribe
they may be, but by the English too; and he is entirely
supported by internal resources, by regular
contributions from the natives, and a private grant
from the governor himself. We can understand something
of the joy with which an honoured missionary,
one of the oldest labourers in the field, sat and listened
in the house of prayer while he officiated, assisted by
the Rev. Rota Waitoa, the only two Maori ministers
of the church of England in New Zealand, and his
own early converts, &#8220;the one reading prayers, and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 305]</span>
the other preaching an admirable sermon to his own
native tribe.&#8221; Other churches have similar triumphs.
The Wesleyans have three native assistant ministers,
and probably these are not all, for it may be presumed
that a great work is going forward in so large an
island, of which our missionary societies have no
official reports, and by agents who are no longer responsible
to them. Thus it is often found that in the
interior some village or hamlet has become Christian
where no European missionary was ever seen. Native
converts have done their own work.</p>

<p>Still the church in New Zealand is in an infant
state, surrounded by many dangers. The influx of
Europeans, the sudden increase of wealth and luxury,
the introduction of a new and foreign literature from
England, bearing as it were upon its wings all that is
bad as well as all that is lovely and of good report in
theology, politics, and morals, may well cause, as
indeed it does create, the deepest concern to those
who have at heart the purity of the Maori faith, and
the continued progress of the gospel. It is not for
those who know that the gospel is the power of God
unto salvation, to doubt for a moment of its ultimate
success; but the firmest faith may, at the same time,
be apprehensive and anxious, if not alarmed, for the
fiery trial that awaits her,&mdash;not of persecution, but of
wealth and luxury, and the sad example of every
European vice. Let the reader help them with his
prayers.</p>

<p>We cannot close our sketch of the progress of
Christianity in New Zealand, without some allusion
to the Canterbury Association, one of the most remarkable
attempts of modern times to colonize on Christian
principles, or rather perhaps we should say, to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 306]</span>
carry abroad the old institutions of England, and
plant them as it were full blown in a new country.
The design was not altogether original, for the New
England puritans of the seventeenth century, had led
the way, in their attempts to colonize at Boston and in
New England, in the days of Charles <span class="smcap">I</span>. They would
have carried out the principles, and worship of the
Brownites to the exclusion of other sects, though
happily for the freedom of religion, their design was
soon found to be impracticable, and was only partially
accomplished. The Canterbury Association was formed
on high church of England principles, &#8220;avowedly for
the purpose of founding a settlement, to be composed
in the first instance of members of that church, or at
least of those who did not object to its principles.&#8221;
Its early friends now admit that their project was, in
some of its parts, utopian and impracticable. The
idea, if ever seriously entertained, of excluding by a
test of church membership those whose profession
differed from their own was abandoned by most of
the colonists as soon as they had set foot on the shores
of New Zealand. In 1848, Otakou or Otago, in the
southern part of the Middle Island, was colonized by
an association of members of the Free Church of Scotland;
and in 1850, the first colonists were sent out to
the church of England settlement, founded in the
vicinity of Banks&#8217;s Peninsula, by the Canterbury
Association. The site made choice of possessed a harbour
of its own, an immense extent of land, which it
was supposed might easily be brought under cultivation,
and removed from danger of disturbance from
the natives, of whom there were but few, an extent of
grazing country unequalled in New Zealand, and a
territory &#8220;every way available for being formed into<span class="pagenum">[Pg 307]</span>
a province, with a separate legislature.&#8221; The plan
was to sell the land at an additional price, and appropriate
one third of the cost to ecclesiastical purposes.
The sums thus realized by sales of land, were to be
placed at the disposal of an ecclesiastical committee,
who were empowered to make such arrangements as
they might think fit to organize an endowed church
in the colony. A bishopric was to be at once endowed,
a college, if not a cathedral, was to be connected with
it, a grammar-school of the highest class, was to be
opened as well as commercial schools; and all the
luxuries of English country life, including good roads,
snug villas, well cultivated farms; and good society,
were to be found by the future settler, after a very
few years of probationary toil.</p>

<p>The scheme was warmly taken up at home, and
within a single twelvemonth from the 16th December,
1850, when the first detachment arrived, nearly three
thousand emigrants had seated themselves in the
Canterbury Plains. The towns of Lyttelton and
Christchurch were founded, and operations on a large
scale were fairly begun. Of course bitter disappointment
followed, as it too often does with the early
colonists, whose expectations are unduly raised by the
romantic stories told them in England. But we must
quote a passage from &#8220;Archdeacon Paul&#8217;s Letters from
Canterbury,&#8221; just published. It may be of use to
other emigrants, into whatever region of the world
they go. &#8220;Restless spirits, who had never yet been
contented anywhere, expected to find tranquillity in
this new Arcadia, where their chief occupation would be
to recline under the shadow of some overhanging rock,
soothing their fleecy charge with the shepherd&#8217;s pipe,
remote from fogs and taxation and all the thousand<span class="pagenum">[Pg 308]</span>
nameless evils which had made their lives a burthen to
them at home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas! the reality was soon found to be of a sterner
type&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 28em;">
<span class="i0">&#8216;These are not scenes for pastoral dance at even,</span>
<span class="i0">For moonlight rovings in the fragrant glades:</span>
<span class="i0">Soft slumbers in the open eye of heaven,</span>
<span class="i0">And all the listless joys of summer shades.&#8217;</span>
</div>

<p>Long wearisome rides and walks in search of truant
sheep and cattle; bivouacs night after night, on the
damp cold ground; mutton, damper, (a kind of coarse
biscuit,) and tea (and that colonial tea) at breakfast,
dinner, and supper, day after day, and week after
week, and month after month; wanderings in trackless
deserts, with a choice of passing the night on
some bleak mountain side or wading through an
unexplored swamp; and, after all this labour, finding
perhaps that his flock are infected, and that no small
amount of money as well as toil must be expended
before he can hope for any profit at all;&mdash;these are
the real experiences of a settler&#8217;s early days in a young
pastoral colony.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet, upon the whole, the founders of the settlement
consider that it has answered all reasonable expectations.
None of the early settlers have been driven
home by the failure of their prospects, and few have
been so even from qualified disappointment. The
plains of Canterbury have a thoroughly English look,
dotted in every direction with comfortable farm-houses,
well-cultivated inclosures, and rickyards filled with
the produce of the harvest: and the great seaport of
the colony, Lyttelton, is well filled with shipping.
Christchurch boasts at length its college, incorporated
and endowed. It became an episcopal see, too, in
1856, under the first bishop of Christchurch; it has<span class="pagenum">[Pg 309]</span>
its grammar school and Sunday schools. Here, too,
as well as at Lyttelton, the Wesleyans have taken
root, and, besides chapels, have their day and Sunday
schools. From the first, the Scotch Church was represented
by some enterprising settlers. The decorum
of religion is everywhere perceptible; &#8220;I believe,&#8221;
writes a nobleman, whose name stands at the head of
the Association, &#8220;that no English colony, certainly
none of modern days, and I hardly except those of the
seventeenth century has been better supplied with the
substantial means of religious worship and education.
No one doubts the great material prosperity and promise
of the colony; and no one denies that it is the
best and most English-like society in all our colonies....
Sometimes a very vain notion has been
entertained that we meant or hoped to exclude dissenters
from our settlement. Of course, nothing
could be more preposterous. What we meant was to
impress the colony in its origin with a strong church
of England character. This was done by the simple
but effectual expedient of appropriating one third of
the original land fund to church purposes, but this
was of course a voluntary system.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus New Zealand stands at present. The lonely
island of the Southern Ocean approached only fifty
years ago with awe by the few adventurous whalers
which dared its unknown coasts and harbours, now
teems with English colonists. The dreaded New
Zealander has forsaken his savage haunts and ferocious
practices, and may be seen &#8220;clothed and in his right
mind,&#8221; and sitting to learn at the feet of some teacher
of &#8220;the truth as it is in Jesus.&#8221; The face of the country
has undergone a corresponding change. And in many
places, the scene is such as to force the tears from the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 310]</span>
eye of the self-exiled settler; the village spire and the
church-going bell reminding him of home. What the
future may be, we shall not even hazard a conjecture.
Let it be enough to say that a mighty change has
already been accomplished, and that its foundations
were laid, and the work itself effected more than by
any other man, by Samuel Marsden.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX II.</h2>

<blockquote><p>State and Prospects of the Protestant Mission at Tahiti under the
French Protectorate.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the period of Mr. Marsden&#8217;s decease, the Tahitian
mission, over which he had watched with parental
solicitude from its infancy, presented an aspect even
more cheering than that of New Zealand. Idolatry
had fallen; its idols were utterly abolished; they had
found their way to the most ignoble uses, or to the
museums of the curious, or those of the various missionary
societies in Great Britain. So complete was
their destruction that natives of Tahiti have actually
visited the museum of the London Missionary Society
within the last few years, and there seen, for the first
time in their lives, a Tahitian idol. But a dark cloud
already skirted the horizon, and the infant church was
soon to pass through the purifying furnace of a long,
relentless, wearying, and even bitter persecution.</p>

<p>The revolution of 1830 had placed Louis Philippe on
the throne of France. During the earlier years of his
reign, the church of Rome was deprived of much of
that power and dignity which it had enjoyed under
the elder Bourbons. As to any hold on the affections
of the people of France, this it seldom boasted,&mdash;certainly
not within the last hundred years. Yet the
crafty king of the French was not unwilling to give to
his restless priesthood the opportunities both of employment
and renown in foreign parts; especially if in
doing so he could extend his own power, and add a
wreath to that national glory so dear to Frenchmen.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 312]</span>
The priests were therefore instructed to direct their
attention to the South Sea Islands. Animated partly
by hatred to England, they succeeded in effecting a
settlement in the Society Islands. The first of them,
who arrived there, called Columban (though his original
name was Murphy), came in rather strange
guise. &#8220;He was clad like a man before the mast,
smoked a short pipe, and at first was mistaken for
what he appeared to be. He had an old English
passport, and among other pious tricks, endeavoured
to make use of the lion and the unicorn, to prove to the
natives that he was sent by the king of Great Britain.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>
Two others, Caret and Laval, arrived soon
afterwards. The law of the island forbade foreigners
to reside without obtaining the sanction of the queen.
The priests, accordingly, when their arrival became
known, were ordered to depart. They refused; comparing
the Protestant missionaries to Simon Magus,
and claiming for themselves the exclusive right to
instruct the Tahitian people. After some delay, however,
they left, and went to the Grambier Islands.
Captain Lord E. Russell, then with his ship of war at
the island, publicly declared, that &#8220;if the priests had
remained in the country, anarchy and confusion, disastrous
to the island, would have inevitably ensued.&#8221;
This was in December, 1836.</p>

<p>In September, 1837, M. Montpellier, accompanied
by Murphy-Columban, arrived at Tahiti. He was
followed in 1838 by Captain Du Petit Thouars in the
frigate Venus, who made no secret in avowing to
our English officers that he was looking out for a suitable
island on which to hoist the French flag for the
purpose, he added, of forming a penal settlement.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 313]</span>Returning to Paris, Thouars was raised to the rank of
rear-admiral, and sent back to the Pacific with his
flag in La Reine Blanche on a secret expedition.
He seized on two of the Marquesas Islands, built a
fort on each, and garrisoned them with four hundred
men. He now wrote home, demanding thrice that
number of troops and four ships of war for the
maintenance of his conquest; but he had further
objects in view. False representations had probably
been made to the French government with regard to
the removal of Caret and Laval; and Captain Du Petit
Thouars was instructed to demand satisfaction at
Tahiti for injuries done to French subjects. A desire
of conquest no doubt inflamed Guizot the French
minister&mdash;alas! that a Protestant should thus have
tarnished his fame&mdash;as well as his royal master; but
hatred of Protestantism had its full share in these
nefarious proceedings.</p>

<p>One M. Henicy, who accompanied the Antoine
French frigate to Tahiti, in the summer of 1839, thus
writes of the English missionaries: &#8220;Ferocious
oppressors, shameless monopolizers, trafficking in the
word of God, they have procured for themselves a
concert of curses. Their ministers are found to be
vile impostors.&#8221; Caret, Murphy, and the other
priests now returned to Tahiti. A French consul was
appointed, a worthless, profligate man; he professed,
however, to be a zealous friend of the true faith,
anxious for missionary labourers to convert the
deluded Tahitian Protestants. Very little progress,
however, could be made in this spiritual work; the
natives obstinately preferred sermons to masses, and
possessed so little taste as to reject pictures and
rosaries while they still read their Bibles. It was<span class="pagenum">[Pg 314]</span>
evident that efforts of a more strenuous kind, though,
such as the church of Rome is never unwilling to
resort to when persuasion fails, must be tried. And
now it was announced that the island was placed under
the protection of France; to this arrangement, it was
pretended, the chiefs of Tahiti and the queen herself
had consented; nay, that they had solicited the protection
of France. This unblushing falsehood was immediately
exposed, and we now know, from queen
Pomare herself, that all the proceedings in this disgraceful
affair had their origin in fraud and treachery.
They were chiefly carried out by the French consul, who
is accused of having, under false pretences, prevailed on
certain chiefs of the island to affix their signatures, in
the name of the queen, to a document, the object of
which was to induce the king of the French to take
Tahiti under his protection, the pretence being grounded
on a false statement, which accused some native chiefs,
and the representatives of other nations, of bad conduct
and various crimes. When the queen was apprised of
this document, she called a council of her chiefs, with
an assembled multitude of natives and foreigners; and,
in the presence of the British, French, and American
consuls, denied all knowledge of it, as also did the
chiefs themselves who signed it. They declared
that the French consul brought it to them in the
night, and that they put their names to it without
knowing what it contained. The governor, being one
of the persons imposed upon, wrote to the British
consul, Mr. Cunningham, declaring that the parties
subscribing did not know what were the contents of
the letter which the French consul brought them to
sign, and that they affixed their names to it, as it were,
in the dark. The translator also affirmed that it must<span class="pagenum">[Pg 315]</span>
have been written by some person not a Tahitian; its
idiom being foreign, its orthography bad, words misapplied,
and the handwriting even foreign.</p>

<p>But the most convincing evidence of the forgery
was the declaration of two of the chiefs who signed the
document, Tati and Ulami, to the following effect:
&#8220;That all men may know, We, who have signed our
names hereunto, clearly and solemnly make known and
declare, as upon oath, that the French consul did
wholly dictate and write the letter, said to be written
by the queen Pomare and her governors, requesting
protection of the king of the French. Through fear
we signed it. It was in his own house, and in the
night time, that the document was signed by us.
And we signed it also because he said, If you will sign
your names to this, I will give you one thousand
dollars each when the French admiral&#8217;s ship returns
to Tahiti.</p>

<p class="quotsig">(Signed) &#8220;<span class="smcap">Tati</span>,<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Ulami</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>This disgraceful plot was carried on in the absence
of the queen. She was no sooner made acquainted
with it, than she addressed a short and dignified
protest and remonstrance to the queen of Great
Britain, the president of the United States, and the
king of the French. Few diplomatic notes are more
worthy of a place in history than that which was
addressed to Louis Philippe.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Peace be to you. I make a communication to
you, and this is its nature,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;During my absence from my own country a few
of my people, entirely without my knowledge or
authority, wrote a letter to you, soliciting your
assistance. I disavow any knowledge of that document.
Health to you.</p>

<p class="quotsig">(Signed) &#8220;<span class="smcap">Pomare</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 316]</span>But the French consul proceeded to form a provisional
government of three persons, placing himself
at the head of it as consul-commissary of the king.
The triumvirate behaved with the greatest insolence,
not only to the poor queen, but even to the British
flag. Captain Sir T. Thompson, with the Talbot,
lay in the harbour. The queen arrived and hoisted
the Tahitian flag, which the Talbot saluted. A
letter from the consul-commissary and the two French
officials with whom he was associated was addressed
as a protest to the gallant captain, &#8220;holding him
responsible to the king of the French, his government
and nation, for the consequences of such disrespect,
and for a measure so hostile towards France.&#8221; Sir
Thomas knew his duty too well to answer the affront,
or in any way to notice it; but he could only look on
with silent sorrow and disgust, he had no power to
interfere. The queen also received an insolent letter
from the consul; he even forced himself into her presence,
and behaved in a rude and disrespectful manner.
&#8220;He said to me,&#8221; she writes, in a letter to the captain
of the Talbot, &#8220;shaking his head at me, throwing
about his arms, and staring fiercely at me, &#8216;Order
your men to hoist the new flags, and that the new
government be respected.&#8217; I protested against this
conduct, and told him I had nothing more to say to
him.&#8221; Bereft of other hope, the insulted and greatly
injured Pomare wrote a most touching and pathetic
letter to queen Victoria. It was published in the
newspapers, and went to the heart of every man and
woman in Britain who had a heart to feel for dignity
and virtue in distress, &#8220;Have compassion on me in
my present trouble, in my affliction and great helplessness.
Do not cast me away; assist me quickly,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 317]</span>
my friend. I run to you for refuge, to be covered,
under your great shadow, the same as afforded to my
fathers by your fathers, who are now dead, and whose
kingdoms have descended to us.&#8221; She explains how
her signature was obtained. &#8220;Taraipa (governor of
Tahiti) said to me, &#8216;Pomare, write your name under
this document (the French deed of protection); if
you don&#8217;t sign your name you must pay a fine of
10,000 dollars, 5000 to-morrow and 5000 the following
day; and should the first payment be delayed
beyond two o&#8217;clock the first day, hostilities will be
commenced, and your country taken from you. On
account of this threat,&#8221; says the queen, &#8220;against my
will I signed my name. I was compelled to sign it,
and because I was afraid; for the British and American
subjects residing in my country in case of hostilities
would have been indiscriminately massacred.
No regard would have been paid to parties.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no exaggeration in this pathetic statement;
it is confirmed by a letter&mdash;one of the last he
ever wrote&mdash;from John Williams, the martyr missionary,
who called at Tahiti, March 1839, on his last
fatal voyage to the New Hebrides. &#8220;You will doubtless
see by the papers the cruel and oppressive conduct
of the French. A sixty-gun frigate has been
sent here to chastise the queen and people of Tahiti
for not receiving the Roman Catholic priests; and the
captain demanded 2000 dollars (10,000?) to be paid
in twenty-four hours, or threatened to carry devastation
and death to every island in the queen&#8217;s dominion.
Mr. Pritchard and some merchants here paid the
money and saved the lives of the people. The French
would only hear one side of the question, but demanded
four things within twenty-four hours: 2000<span class="pagenum">[Pg 318]</span>
dollars (10,000), a letter of apology to the French
king, a salute of twenty-one guns, and the hoisting of
the French flag.&#8221;</p>

<p>In short, the island became a French dependency,
and the poor queen was left with the mere shadow of
her former sovereignty. And so it remains to this
day. A strong feeling of indignation was aroused in
England. Missionary meetings, particularly a noble
one at Leeds, were held, pledging themselves to do all
in their power to induce our government to exert its
legitimate influence with the government of France
to restore to the queen of Tahiti her just independence,
and to all classes of her subjects their civil
rights and religious freedom. But the English government
was either infatuated or afraid. Lord Aberdeen,
secretary of state for colonial affairs, stated in
the House of Lords that, &#8220;although he was not sufficiently
informed of the precise grounds upon which
the French government had acted, or of the complaints
made against the authorities in those islands
which had led to the convention; yet he had no apprehension
as to the establishment of the French in
those seas, nor that our commercial or political interests
would be affected by it.&#8221; He stated that &#8220;he
had received the most unqualified assurance that every
degree of protection and encouragement would be
afforded to the British missionaries residing in those
islands; that in granting the protectorship to the
French king, it had been stipulated that all the places
of worship at present existing would receive protection,
and that the fullest liberty would be given to
the missionaries to exercise their functions.&#8221; And he
concluded by saying, &#8220;that he reposed the fullest confidence,
not only in the king of the French himself,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 319]</span>
but in the minister, who at this moment was the principal
adviser of that monarch.&#8221; But a righteous God
looked on. This king was driven from his throne,
and died an exile in England; while his minister, M.
Guizot, who sacrificed his Protestantism to his ambition
in this matter, after escaping with difficulty in
1848, from a mob who would have torn him to pieces,
saw himself compelled to give up for ever all hope of
recovering power in France.</p>

<p>From that time to the present all political power
and influence has centred in the French governors,
who have been sent out from Europe, and their subordinate
officers. Pomare still lives, revered by her
people, but without being able to exercise any one
independent act of sovereignty; and the native chiefs
and governors who formerly took a prominent part in
all public affairs, and in their respective districts possessed
great influence, are without a vestige of authority,
except in those instances in which they have
been induced to accept office under the French governor.
In 1842, a treaty, so called, was framed,
which did indeed provide for &#8220;the freedom of religious
worship, and especially that the English missionaries
shall continue in their labours without molestation.&#8221;
&#8220;The same shall apply,&#8221; says its fifth article, &#8220;to
every other form of worship: no one shall be molested
or constrained in his belief.&#8221; But this treaty
was probably intended only to cajole those whom it
could not intimidate, and in practice it is a mere
dead letter. The treaty itself is brief and informal,
and evidently drawn up in haste, or perhaps with a
view, from the absence of precision in its language,
to provide for its more easy violation. Yet if the
language in which it is couched conveys any meaning<span class="pagenum">[Pg 320]</span>
the treaty provides that the people of the island, and
the English missionaries in the prosecution of their
labours amongst them, shall continue to enjoy unrestricted
religious liberty. Now it might be urged,
and with some plausibility, by the French authorities
in Tahiti, that the people are still allowed, as heretofore,
to attend their public worship, and to retain their
Bibles and Christian books. They might even maintain,
that although a number of Romish priests, with
a bishop at their head, have been thrust upon the
island, no Protestant missionary has been expelled by
the act of the authorities. The substantial truth of
these statements cannot be denied, and yet there is
abundant evidence that the clauses of the treaty
guaranteeing the religious liberty of the islanders and
the missionaries have, for every practical purpose,
been palpably and grossly violated. The places of
worship have not indeed been closed, but the English
missionaries have, from time to time, been placed
under such severe restrictions that four of their number,
finding themselves entirely debarred from the free
exercise of their ministry, left the island in 1852.
There are at present but two missionaries remaining.
One of these is solely engaged in the operations of the
press, but without permission to preach to the people;
and the other&mdash;far advanced in age&mdash;is merely permitted,
by a kind of sufferance, to remain at his post,
and to minister to his own flock, though prohibited
from extending his labours to other districts. So far
as the churches and congregations scattered over the
island are still supplied with the means of religious
instruction, it is by the agency of natives, many of
whom were formerly trained to the work by the missionaries.
But these native preachers are subject to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 321]</span>
the constant inspection and interference of the authorities,
and they hold their offices solely by sufferance.
It will thus be seen, that although the English
missionaries have not been forcibly ejected from the
island, the object aimed at by the French authorities
has, through the artful policy they have adopted, been
effectually attained. The missionaries have been
silenced, disowned, and cast aside.</p>

<p>In pursuance of the same cautious and subtle policy,
the French rulers have not ventured to excite or
irritate the people by sanctioning any hasty measures
for enforcing conformity to the Roman Catholic faith;
still they have encouraged the formation of elementary
schools, in which the young people are taught by
priests appointed by the government, and everything
is done to give undue importance to these schools, so
that the pupils taught in them may, at the periodical
examinations, appear to more advantage than those
under native masters.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the prevalence of a system so calculated
to ensnare and mystify the minds of a simple
unsuspicious people, it is a most remarkable and gratifying
fact that instances of apostasy to Romanism
have been exceedingly rare, and that the bulk of the
people continue stedfast in their attachment to the
pure Scriptural truths taught them by the missionaries.
To account for this it should be borne in mind that
the churches and congregations still assemble as heretofore
for Divine worship under native pastors, some
of whom are known to be pious, devoted, and well qualified
men. Then again, through the active and efficient
agency of the Rev. W. Howe, who, though prohibited
from preaching, still remains in charge of the mission
press at Papeete, the native pastors and people have<span class="pagenum">[Pg 322]</span>
been well supplied with religious books. And it is further
to be noted that the natives generally are amply
provided with copies of the sacred Scriptures in their
own language, which will no doubt, in the good providence
of God, prove an effectual safeguard against
popish error and superstition. In the year 1847, five
thousand copies of the entire Tahitian Bible, revised
by the Rev. Messrs Howe and Joseph, and generously
provided by the British and Foreign Bible Society,
were sent out in the missionary ship John Williams for
circulation in Tahiti and the other islands of the
Society group; and again, in 1852, three thousand
copies of the New Testament were despatched to
Tahiti, chiefly for the use of schools.</p>

<p>In proof that the social and political troubles of the
island have not had the effect of diminishing the number
of its Christian population, the following most satisfactory
statement, furnished by Mr. Howe, dated
11th July, 1856, may be adduced.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have been comparing the number of persons in
church fellowship at the present time with the numbers
respectively before the establishment of the
French protectorate, and at the period when it had
become fully established. In 1842, there were about
one thousand six hundred and eighty church members
in Tahiti and Eimeo. In 1851, when the island of
Tahiti was supplied by three foreign missionaries, and
the students in the seminary, the report of the Society
stated the number of church members to be upwards
of one thousand six hundred, which is probably equal
to that of 1842. Almost ever since that period the
districts have been entirely supplied by native pastors
only, with the exception of Bunaauia; and there are
at the present time upwards of one thousand six hun<span class="pagenum">[Pg 323]</span>dred
members on the two islands, and many are now
seeking admission. It must also be borne in mind
that during the interval between 1851 and the present
time, the population of the two islands has been
reduced by epidemic disease and removals at least
one thousand, a large proportion of whom were
church members from middle to old age, so that the
present number in fellowship is comprised of the
strength and pride of the nation, and the proportion
of communicants to the population is greater than it
has ever been.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Of the kind of annoyance to which the missionaries
are exposed, and of the influences which are brought
to bear against them, the reader will be able to
judge after perusing the account of a prosecution
lately instituted by the Romish bishop against the
Rev. Mr. Howe. In the autumn of 1855, the Roman
Catholic bishop having issued a catechism in which
the doctrines and superstitions of Popery were dogmatically
stated, and Protestantism as grossly misrepresented,
Mr. Howe felt constrained, by a sense of
Christian fidelity, to publish in reply a firm but temperate
refutation. For this publication a criminal
action was commenced against him by the bishop; but
so vexatious and unfounded were the charges that the
legal officer of the government, on whom it devolved to
prosecute, though urged by the governor, declined to
bring the case into court, for which he was suspended
from his office; and when at length the case was
carried before the proper tribunal, the charges against
our missionary were dismissed. But the bishop, notwithstanding
his signal discomfiture, was not to be
diverted from his object; he determined to renew the
contest, in the hope that by a change of tactics his<span class="pagenum">[Pg 324]</span>
ultimate object might be secured. The <i>criminal</i> prosecution
already described was brought to a termination
in December. On the following 15th of March,
Mr. Howe received notice that his inveterate opponent
had entered a <i>civil</i> action against him; and although
the charges brought forward were essentially the
same, they were put into such a shape, and contained
statements so grossly exaggerated, that in order to
meet them Mr. Howe was compelled to remodel his
reply.</p>

<p>After various delays, the trial at length commenced,
in the court of First Instance, on the 28th April,
1856, and in proof of the malevolence by which the
bishop was actuated, it may be stated that he demanded
30,000 francs damages, the suppression of the
Tatara-taa,<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> and that Mr. Howe should pay all the
expenses of the courts, and also for 2000 copies of
the judgment for distribution.</p>

<p>The following is a summary of the proceedings,
which excited the liveliest interest in the island, both
among the natives and the foreign residents.</p>

<p>&#8220;My pleadings,&#8221; writes Mr. Howe, &#8220;were so successful
that the court declared itself incompetent to
judge the case, and fined his lordship 100 francs, and
condemned him to all the expenses of that court and
those of the preceding chambers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The judgment was read on the 3rd of May. On
the 10th I received notice that the bishop had appealed
to the Imperial Tribunal, and demanded that the previous
judgment should be rescinded.</p>

<p>&#8220;This tribunal met on the 16th, when I objected
to one of the judges, giving as my reasons that an
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 325]</span>intimacy existed between him and the bishop, which
rendered his sitting as a judge in the case illegal. My
objection was sustained by the court.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the 17th, I objected to his lordship&#8217;s advocate,
as being under the sentence of banishment for political
offences, and by which he had forfeited his civil rights.
This was also sustained by the court.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the 26th, the bishop himself appeared to plead
his own cause, and he likewise objected to one of the
judges, but his objection was overruled. Suffice it to
say, that after having made several unsuccessful attempts
to prove my defence unsound, the bishop beat
a retreat, and said that if I would consent to submit
my cause to arbitration he would withdraw the action.
I demanded that his cause, to which this is an answer,
should be submitted to the same test, and he consented.</p>

<p>&#8220;The court then retired, and on its return announced
its judgment to be, that the decisions of the
previous courts were sustained, and that the bishop
should pay all the expenses of this appeal, as well as
the expenses of the previous courts. By this step his
lordship cannot appeal again, either to the administration
here, or to the Court of Cassation in France.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is gratifying to learn, that through this long and
painful affair, our missionary not only had the countenance
of the British and American consuls, and the
fervent prayers of the native converts, both in public
and private, but that even the French officers, greatly
to their honour, openly expressed their sympathy.</p>

<p>In order more fully to appreciate the result of this
protracted contest, it should be borne in mind that
the real point at issue was, whether the cause of Protestant
Christianity, as represented by Mr. Howe,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 326]</span>
should be permitted to hold a footing in the island;
that Mr. Howe stood alone, unsustained, excepting
by a stedfast confidence in the justice of his cause,
and the generous aid and sympathy of friends, French,
English, and native, who rallied round him in the
time of need; that his potent adversary could reasonably
calculate on the countenance and encouragement
of the authorities, who, as Frenchmen and Roman
Catholics, would naturally be disposed to favour the
interests of their own church, and to repress what
they had been taught to regard as heresy. But in
the providence of God, the presiding judges of the
French tribunals before which the cause was heard
magnanimously regardless of all prejudices on the
score of nationality or religion, delivered a judgment
which, while completely exculpating the accused, reflected
the highest honour upon their own discernment,
impartiality, and justice. While, therefore we
devoutly recognise the hand of God so conspicuously
manifest in overruling and directing this trial, or
rather series of trials, to so merciful an issue, we
would add the expression of our hope and belief that
so long as the cause of Protestant Christianity is
represented in Tahiti by men like-minded with Mr.
Howe, and so long as the courts of justice on the
island are presided over by men who, without fear or
favour, dispense their judgments in accordance with
the principles of truth and equity, the light of the
gospel, which has for so many years made glad the
hills and valleys of Tahiti, can never be extinguished.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

Gutenberg-tm License.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
